biographies see p372\nANJA MUTIC \u00b4 Coordinating Author\nHere I am standing on the crusty salts of Salar de Uyuni (p174), in awe of my surroundings \nbut at the same time wondering if I\u2019ll reach my destination for the night. It\u2019s the rainy season and the jeep driver is nervously navigating the salty terrain riddled with water puddles and cracks. I\u2019ve heard of people getting stuck in the Salar for days during the rains so I\u2019m quite happy and relieved once we reach solid ground at the edge of salt. \nPAUL SMITH  Here I am killing \ntime in the 40\u00b0C heat of the Chaco (p256) as the bus driv-ers try to dig us out of the hole they have just driven us into. Everybody seemed to have a helpful piece of ad-vice on how to get us out of the fix, but nobody was prepared to put their money where their mouth was and physically help dig the bus out of the deep sand it was trapped in. It was far too much like hard work!\nKATE ARMSTRONG  I\u2019m at heady heights overlooking La Paz \n(p60), amazed at the incongruity of this thriving city, the melting pot of both the modern and traditional. I love its harsh environment. In awe of its sprawling urbanization, I am also conscious that this reflects both the threats and opportunities of globalization. On the edge of La Paz, I ponder how the city, too, is on a rocky precipice in a quest to balance both its future and its past. \n00-prelims-bol7.indd   400-prelims-bol7.indd   4 10/12/09   15:16:5610/12/09   15:16:56\u00a9 Lonely Planet", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1495, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "249bb62c-c0b0-4442-823c-51164ca568ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "249bb62c-c0b0-4442-823c-51164ca568ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) -

The hemisphere\u2019s highest, most isolated and most rugged nation, it\u2019s among the earth\u2019s coldest, warmest and windiest spots, with some of the driest, saltiest and swampiest natural landscapes in the world. It\u2019s also a land of paradoxes: South America\u2019s poorest country, Bolivia is the richest on the continent in natural resources. But the superlatives don\u2019t end here. Over 60% of the population claim indigenous heritage, including Aymar\u00e1, Quechua and Guaran\u00ed, making it South America\u2019s most indigenous country. \nBolivia\u2019s natural treasures are many and marvelous, from soaring \nmountain peaks and surreal salt flats to steamy jungles and wildlife-rich grasslands. Exploring the cultural a spect \u2013 the country\u2019s vibrant ancient \ntraditions and preserved colonial cities \u2013 offers unparalleled delight. Most visitors stick to the well-worn paths of the Altiplano, but there\u2019s plenty to see and do elsewhere, from dense rainforests to snowcapped cordilleras. While Bolivia is now well and truly on the travelers\u2019 radar, it\u2019s still largely raw and undeveloped. This may be a boon for intrepid travelers, but it\u2019s a perennial source of problems for Bolivians \u2013 notable changes have been sweeping Bolivia\u2019s formidable landscapes in the last few years.\nSince 2005, Bolivia has been undergoing a revolution of sorts virtually \nsynonymous with former cocalero  (coca grower) Evo Morales, Bolivia\u2019s \nfirst indigenous president.\n In January 2009, he pushed through a ground-\nbreaking new constitution. Approved in a nationwide referendum by 67% of the population, it grants previously unheard-of rights to the country\u2019s indigenous majority and allows the president to seek a second five-year term in office. \nThis was stellar news for the working classes and the indigenous \npopulation of the western highlands but not for everyone in Bolivia. In fact, many middle- and upper-class Bolivians, especially in the energy-rich eastern provinces, are vehemently critical of Morales\u2019 anticapitalist stands and socialist ideologies. This opposition led to violent protests in autonomy-hungry Santa Cruz in September 2008 (with 11 dead), and the alleged attempt at presidential assassination in April 2009. \nAnother hot topic is the trial of former president, \u2018Goni\u2019 S\u00e1nchez de \nLozada, who stands accused, together with 16 members of his cabinet, for 67 deaths during the 2003 protests in La Paz. The trial opened in May 2009 in absentia; Goni still lives in Maryland and the unheeded request to the US for extradition is one of several sore points (including the controversial coca) between Bolivia and the USA. Since the diplomatic talks in spring 2009, the worn ties between the two have been on the slow mend.\nIn addition to Bolivia\u2019s internal strife, Morales has other things on \nhis plate, such as the management of Bolivia\u2019s so far untapped lithium reserves (the world\u2019s largest) and the election in December 2009. With his approval ratings still high, at presstime it looked like he was in for a second term. How he will manage to keep his polarized country in check remains to be seen.

Having said that, most stick to the more accessible and well-worn routes and don\u2019t give it the attention it warrants. For the more motivated and curious traveler, this means there will be plenty of stimulation if you venture off the tourist track \u2013 it\u2019s so easy to do. All travelers to Bolivia will be delighted by the multilayered, rich and varied cultures, stunning natural beauty, and unforgettable experiences and characters. Adventure nuts will also be well sated: there are plenty of opportunities for outdoor action, with a wide variety of luxury levels and travel choices on offer. The going isn\u2019t always easy, but the rewards are well worth the effort.\nWHEN TO GO\nTravelers will encounter just about every climatic zone, from stifling humidity and heat to arctic cold. Summer (November to April) is the rainy season, when overland transportation becomes difficult if not impossible in some areas. The most popular, and arguably most comfort-able, time for exploring the whole country is during the dry, clear days of winter (May to October).\nMost of Bolivia lies as near to the equator as Tahiti or Hawaii, but \nits elevation and unprotected expanses result in unpredictable weather. Bolivia\u2019s two poles of climatic extremes are Puerto Su\u00e1rez with its over-whelming heat, and Uyuni with its icy, cold winds. But there are no absolutes; there are times when you can sunbathe in Uyuni and freeze \nin Puerto Su\u00e1rez.\nSummer (rainy season) in the lowlands can be utterly miserable, with \nmud, high humidity, biting insects and relentless tropical downpours. However, washed-out roads means there is an increase in river transpor-tation, making this the best time to hop on a cargo boat. Winter in the Altiplano means extreme heat during the day, and freezing winds and subzero temperatures at night. The highland valleys are refuges, having a comfortable climate and little rain year round.See climate charts (p330) \nfor more information.\nDON\u2019T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT\n\u0084 Checking the visa situation (p339)\n\u0084 Checking travel advisory warnings (p330)\n\u0084 Proof of vaccination for yellow fever (p356)\n\u0084 A copy of your travel insurance policy details (p334)\n\u0084 Plug adaptor for your camera battery charger (p329)\n\u0084 Binoculars for wildlife watching \n\u0084 Sunscreen and a hat for the clear skies at 4000m \n\u0084 First aid kit (p352)\n\u0084 Ear plugs for disco nights you want to sleep through\n\u0084 A pack lock or other luggage security for peace of mind\n\u0084 Your sense of humor \u2013 both patience and courage will be tested in queues and on bus rides\n04-getting-started-bol7.indd   13 04-getting-started-bol7.indd   13 8/12/09   09:27:35 8/12/09   09:27:35", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2784, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46a68295-4f6e-4b1d-84c5-0f058b4fd0f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "46a68295-4f6e-4b1d-84c5-0f058b4fd0f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "45b0fbba-c0c9-4956-8078-2eb333644ff9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "d3f28dbc619278e7786f319d3ea550ef292fee5b1552c54547dbcf3728029756", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com 14   GETTING STARTED  \u2022\u2022  Costs & Money\nAugust is the most popular month of the high tourist season, which \nruns from late May to early September. High season sees the most reli-able weather and coincides wit h European and North American summer \nholidays. It\u2019s also when most of Bolivia\u2019s major festivals take place, so many Bolivians and South Americans travel at this time as well. This can be an advantage if you are looking for people to form a travel group, but prices are generally higher than during the rest of the year.\nCOSTS & MONEY\nOverall, prices are slightly lower here than in neighboring countries. The big-gest cost in any trip to Bolivia will be transportation, especially getting there (and, to a lesser extent, getting around, as the distances involved are great).\nWhile ultrabudget travelers can get by on less than US$17 per day, most \npeople will spend between US$25 and US$50. Visitors who want to enjoy the best Bolivia has to offer can easily travel comfortably for US$150 a day (this would include hire of private transportation). Most prices in this book are quoted in bolivianos (B$). Avoid over-bargaining with local people for goods and services just for the sake of it. While Bolivians themselves might bargain among their friends at markets, bargaining is not actually a common cultural practice. In any case, be realistic about how much you are actually saving \u2013  the few bolivianos you might save can be worth a great deal more to the locals than to you. If you feel uncomfortable about pricing issues, ask locals for a ballpark idea of what you can expect to pay for something, including taxis. Always agree on food, accommodations and transportation prices beforehand to avoid any unpleasant situations.\nTRAVEL LITERATURE\nSitting at the top of the South American travelogue list is the humorous and well-written Inca-Kola,  by Matthew Parris. It follows the meander-\nings of several Englishmen on a rollicking circuit throughout Peru and parts of Bolivia.\nA great read, especially if you\u2019re traveling in the lowlands, is Jungle: \nA Harrowing True Story of Survival  (originally published as Back from \nTuichi ) by Yossi Ghinsberg; it\u2019s about an Israeli traveler who gets lost \nin the Parque Nacional Madidi in the early 1980s and how he finds his way out of the jungle.\n Other travel books that are worth noting include \nChasing Ch\u00e9: A Motorcycle Journey in Search of the Guevara Legend,  \nby Patrick Symmes, and The Incredible Voyage: A Personal Odyssey,  by \nTristan Jones, which follows the intrepid sailor\u2019s journey through landlocked Bolivia on Lake Titicaca and beyond. An offbeat historical character is portrayed in Lizzie: A Victorian Lady\u2019s Amazon Adventure,  \ncompiled by Anne Rose from the letters of Lizzie Hessel, who lived in the Bolivian Amazon settlement of Colonia Orton during the rubber boom of the early 20th century. Exploration Fawcett,  by Percy Fawcett, \nis a fabulous jungle travel book from the early 20th century.\nLess travelogue and more history book is the comprehensive synthesis \nof recent Bolivian political history, Bolivia: Between a Rock and a Hard \nPlace,  by Pete Good, which provides the most up-to-date commentary \non Bolivia. You can find copies for sale in many travel agencies and hotels in La Paz. The Fat Man from La Paz: Contemporary Fiction from \nBolivia,  a collection of short stories edited by Rosario Santos, is a widely \nrecommended read. For a good synopsis of Bolivian history, politics and culture, check out Bolivia in Focus,  by Robert Werner.\nSome good suggestions for books in general are available if you look \non the excellent website www.libreriaboliviana.com (in Spanish).HOW MUCH?\nDorm bed US$2-8\nAlmuerzo (set lunch) \nUS$1-2.50\nInternet per hour \nUS$0.15-2\nHotel room (double) \nUS$25\nCity taxi fare \nUS$0.75-1.50\nSee also the Lonely \nPlanet Index, inside front cover.\n04-getting-started-bol7.indd   14 04-getting-started-bol7.indd   14 8/12/09   09:27:35 8/12/09   09:27:35", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3992, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5b9fc75-0891-436c-bff2-272110f8e2c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5b9fc75-0891-436c-bff2-272110f8e2c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01b6b0bb-9d34-4d4c-92cb-1bf9f4612286", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "fa0651d864d95c0ad7f5a915948abf5978dbc3fa9ff924ad76dfacf106d9dc94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com GETTING STARTED  \u2022\u2022  Top Picks   15\nFESTIVALS & EVENTS\nThanks to their rich culture, imbibed with tradition, Bolivians are big on celebrating.

Start by enjoying the views of Lake Titicaca from white-washed Copacabana (p99), eating the local trout dishes and getting some R&R. \nAfter a day or two, hike to the tiny port of Yampupata  (p109), visiting the\nvillages along the way for a reed-boat ride. From Y ampupata (or nearby villages) or Copacabana, you can take a boat across Lake Titicaca to tranquil Isla del Sol (p109). Walk from the island\u2019s north to south and \nexplore the Inca ruins. Marvel at Illampu in the distance over Isla de la Luna and then head back to the mainland.\nBack on the mainland, jump on a tourist bus for a trip across the \nstunning Cordillera Real toward La Paz (see p60). For a side trip to the \nremarkably tranquil Sorata  (p133), catch another bus at the Sorata turn-\noff. Chill in this oasis or do some serious hiking or downhill mountain biking. Once in La Paz, spend a few days acclimatizing and absorbing the smells and sights in the hectic markets, fascinating museums and top-class restaurants and caf\u00e9s.

From Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Cordillera de Sama\u2019s  (p254) slice of the Al-\ntiplano, to the inundated savannas of the remote, but spectacular, Parque Nacional Noel Kempff Mercado  (p318), flora and fauna fans will be \nin their element. Although some of these protected areas can be dif-ficult to access, the following places are worth every ounce of the effort they take to reach.\nParque Nacional Sajama  (p163) with its vicu\u00f1as, soaring volcanoes (in-\ncluding Bolivia\u2019s highest peak) and heavenly hot springs was Bolivia\u2019s first reserve. Parque Nacional Madidi (p308) is possibly now the best known, \nencompassing one of the most biodiverse \nhabitats in the world and featuring numerous protected species.\nParque Nacional Carrasco  (p300) and Parque \nNacional Tunari  (p201) are two of the more ac-\ncessible, middle-altitude cloud forests, while Parque Nacional y \u00c1rea de Uso M\u00faltiple Ambor\u00f3  \n(p276) is a prime place for bird-watching.\n\u00c1rea Natural de Manejo Integrado Nacional \nApolobamba (p146) is one of the least visited \nnational parks, while the most popular, Reserva \nNacional de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa (p173), \nreceives tens of thousands of visitors per year and is part of the Southwest Circuit.\nPLANES, TRAINS & CAMIONES\nIn Bolivia, getting there is an important part of the travel experience, and often half the fun! The means of transportation can be the highlight (okay, and sometimes lowlight) of your adventure.\nFrom the sluggish Trans-Chiquitano train (p292) to the most remote R\u00edo \nMamor\u00e9 river journeys  (p314), you\u2019re spoiled for choice when it comes to \nmobility options.\nFoolhardy mountain-bike adventurers shouldn\u2019t pass up the chance \nto conquer the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Road  (p75) or settle instead for \nsingle-track pistes around La Paz  (p60), Sorata  (p133) and Sucre (p210). \nFlying  (p322) in a small plane into remote Parque Nacional Noel Kempff \nMercado will satisfy the most snap-happy traveler. In Trinidad, piling yourself and your gear on to a chauffeured moto-taxi  (p315) is as much \nfun as renting one independently.\nSeveral days of bumping around the South-\nwest Circuit  (p173; including the Salar de Uyuni) \nby 4WD is worth it for the scenery alone. Romantic reed-boat journeys or hydrofoil cruises on Lake Titicaca  (p97) provide a tranquil \nchange of pace. Or, for those wanting a rush, you can raft (p297) into the Amazon Basin.\nLet\u2019s not forget our humble feet, the best \nform of mobility in Bolivia. Awe-inspiring trek-king includes via Inca trails to the Yunga Cruz \ntrek (p129). As for the inevitable travel on buses \nor camiones  (flatbed trucks)?

While it\u2019s been inhabited for thousands of years, the region\u2019s early cultures were shaped by the imperial designs of two major forces: the Tiwanaku culture of Bolivia and the Inca of Peru.\nMost archaeologists define the prehistory of the Central Andes in \nterms of \u2018horizons\u2019 \u2013 Early, Middle and Late \u2013 each of which was charac-terized by distinct architectural and artistic trends. Cultural interchanges between the early Andean peoples occurred mostly through trade, usuallybetween nomadic tribes or as a result of the diplomatic expansionist activities of powerful and well-organized societies. These interchanges resulted in the Andes\u2019 emergence as the cradle of South America\u2019s highest cultural achievements.\nDuring the initial settlement of the Andes, from the arrival of nomads, \nprobably from Siberia, until about 1400 BC, villages and ceremonial centers were established, and trade emerged between coastal fishing communities and farming villages of the highlands.\nEARLY & MIDDLE HORIZONS\nThe so-called Early Horizon (1400\u2013400 BC) was an era of architectural innovation and activity, most evident in the ruins of Chav\u00edn de Huantar, on the eastern slopes of the Ande s in Peru. Chav\u00edn influences resounded \nfar and wide, even after the decline of Chav\u00edn society, and spilled over into the Early Middle Horizon (400 BC\u2013AD 500).\nThe Middle Horizon (AD 500\u2013900) was marked by the imperial expan-\nsion of the Tiwanaku and Huari (of the Ayacucho Valley of present-day Peru) cultures. The Tiwanakans produced technically advanced work, most notably the city itself. They created impressive ceramics, gilded \nornamentation, engraved pillars and slabs with calendar markings and designs representing their bearded white leader and deity, Viracocha.\nBy 700 BC, Tiwanaku had developed into a thriving civilization. Con-\nsidered as advanced as ancient Egypt in many respects, it had an extensive system of roads, irrigation canals and agricultural terraces.

One specu-lation is that Tiwanaku was uprooted by a drop in Lake Titicaca\u2019s water level, which left the lakeside settlement far from shore. Another theory \npostulates that it was attacked and its population massacred by the war-like Kollas (also known as the Aymar\u00e1) from the west. When the Spanish \narrived, they were told an Inca legend about a battle between the Kollas and \u2018bearded white men\u2019 on an island in Lake Titicaca. These men were presumably Tiwanakans, only a few of whom were able to escape. Some researchers believe that the displaced survivors migrated southward and developed into the Chipaya people of the western Oruro department.\nToday the remains of the city lie on the plain between La Paz and the \nsouthern shore of Lake Titicaca, and collections of Tiwanaku relics can be seen in several Bolivian museums. For further information, see p93.\nLATE HORIZON \u2013 THE INCA\nThe period between 900 and 1475 is known as the Late Inter mediate Horizon. Little is known about this era apart from the fact that it was marked by a clutch of regional states, each one with a distinct culture. The Late Horizon (1476\u20131534), in contrast, marked the zenith of Inca civiliza-tion. The Inca, the last of Sout h America\u2019s indigenous conqueror s, arrived \nshortly after the fall of Tiwanaku. Th ey pushed their empire from its seat \nof power in Cuzco (Peru) eastward into present-day Bolivia, southward to the northern reaches of modern Argentina and Chile, and northward through present-day Ecuador and southern Colombia.\nThe Inca inhabited the Cuzco region from the 12th century and be-\nlieved they were led by descendents of the Sun God. The 17th-century Spanish chronicler Fernando Montesinos believed that the Inca were more likely descended from a lineage of Tiwanaku sages. \nRenowned for their great stone cities and skill in working with gold \nand silver, the Inca also set up a hierarchy of governmental and agri-cultural overseers, a viable social welfare scheme and a complex road network and communication system that defied the difficult terrain of their far-flung empire. \nAround 1440 the Inca started to expand their political boundaries. The \neighth Inca, Viracocha (not to be confused with the Tiwanaku leader/deity of the same name), believed the mandate from the Sun God was not just to conquer, plunder and enslave, but to organize defeated tribes and absorb them into the realm of  the benevolent Sun God. The Kollas \n(Bolivians) living around the Tiwanaku site were essentially absorbed by the Inca and their religion was supplanted; they were permitted to keep their language and social traditions.It is believed that \nbetween 1200 and 1475 the Incas used the essential oil of the coca plant to remove brain tumors.\n06-history-bol7.indd   22 06-history-bol7.indd   22 8/12/09   09:32:48 8/12/09   09:32:48", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3729, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1972a3f-df4c-43ee-a463-25253ac12ee9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1972a3f-df4c-43ee-a463-25253ac12ee9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da2313a5-bf39-4a16-9844-02fd84fd1687", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "43e910d641656ba37ed426442976d70e0825a07a94b7daedf2090cab65c3acbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\nThe wandering Indian Diego \nHuallpa discovers silver in Potos\u00ed\u2019s Cerro Rico (Rich Mountain), which leads to the development of the world\u2019s most prolific silver mine.1544 1545 1809\nPotos\u00ed is founded as a mining town but, due to the incrediblewealth of its silver mine, it grows rapidly and gains a mint, 86 churches and a population approaching 200,000 by 1672.In May 1809, Bolivia proclaims \nits independence from Spain by establishing the first juntas (autonomist governments); the first in Chuquisaca (later renamed Sucre) and then in La Paz.HISTORY  \u2022\u2022  Spanish Conquest   23\nBy the late 1520s internal rivalries began to take their toll on the empire, \nmarking the beginning of the end of the Inca political state, having thrived for less than a century. In a brief civil war over the division of lands, Atahualpa, the true Inca emperor\u2019s half-brother, imprisoned the emperor and assumed the throne himself.\nSPANISH CONQUEST\nThe arrival of the Spanish in Ecuador in 1531 was the ultimate blow to \nthe Inca. Within a year, Francisco Pizarro, Diego de Almagro and their bands of conquistadores arrived in Cuzco. Atahualpa, while still the emperor, was not considered the true heir of the Sun God. The Spanish \nwere also aided by the Inca belief that the bearded white men had been sent by the great Viracocha Inca as revenge for Atahualpa\u2019s breach of established protocol. In fear, Atahualpa ordered the murder of the real \nking, which not only ended the bloodline of the Inca dynasty but brought shame on the family and dissolved the psychological power grip of the Inca hierarchy. Within two years the government was conquered, the empire dissolved and the invaders had divided the Inca lands and booty \nbetween the two leaders of the Spanish forces.\nAlto Per\u00fa (which later became Bolivia) fell briefly into the possession \nof Diego de Almagro, who was assassinated in 1538. Three years later, Pizarro suffered the same fate at the hands of mutinous subordinates. But this didn\u2019t deter the Spanish, who kept exploring and settling their newly conquered land. In 1538 La Plata (later known as Sucre) was founded as the Spanish capital of the Charcas region.\nThe Legacy of Potos\u00ed\nBy the time Diego Huallpa revealed his earth-shattering discovery of silver at Cerro Rico in Potos\u00ed in 1544, Spanish conquerors had already firmly implanted their language, religion and customs on the remnants of Atahualpa\u2019s empire. \nSpanish Potos\u00ed, or the \u2018Villa Imperial de Carlos V,\u2019 was officially \nfounded in 1545 and quickly grew to have a population of 160,000, making it the largest city in the west ern hemisphere. The Potos\u00ed mine \nalso became the world\u2019s most prolific, and the silver extracted from it underwrote Spain\u2019s economy, particularly the extravagance of its mon-archy, for at least two centuries.\nAtrocious conditions in the mines of Potos\u00ed guaranteed a short life \nspan for the local indigenous conscripts and African slaves who were herded into work gangs.

By the early 1820s, General Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar had succeeded in liberating both Venezuela and Colombia from Spanish domination. In 1822 he dispatched Mariscal (Major General) Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre to Ecuador to defeat the Royalists at the battle of Pichincha. In 1824, after years of guerrilla action against the Spanish and the victories of Bol\u00edvar and Sucre in the battles of Jun\u00edn (August 6) and Ayacucho (December 9), Peru won its independence.\nSucre then incited a declaration of independence from Alto Per\u00fa and, \nin 1825, the new Republic of Bolivia was born. Bol\u00edvar and Sucre served as Bolivia\u2019s first and second presidents but, after a brief attempt by the third president, Andr\u00e9s Santa Cruz, to form a confederation with Peru, things began to go awry. One military junta after another usurped power from its predecessor, setting a pattern of political strife that haunts the nation to this day.\nFew of Bolivia\u2019s 192 governments to date have remained in power long \nenough to have much intentional effect. \nSHRINKING TERRITORY\nAt the time of independence Bolivia\u2019s boundaries encompassed well over 2 million sq km. Its neighbors soon moved to acquire its territory though, removing coastal access and much of the area covered by its ancient Amazonian rubber trees. \nThe coastal loss occurred during the War of the Pacific, fought against \nChile between 1879 and 1884. Many Bolivians believe that Chile stole the Atacama Desert\u2019s copper- and nitrate-rich sands and 850km of coastline from Peru and Bolivia by invading during Carnaval. Chile did attempt to compensate for the loss by building a railroad from La Paz to the ocean and allowing Bolivia free port privileges in Antofagasta, but Bolivians have never forgotten this devastating enclaustramiento  (landlocked status). \nThe next major loss was in 1903 during the rubber boom when Brazil \nhacked away at Bolivia\u2019s inland expanse. Brazil and Bolivia had both been ransacking the forests of the Acre territory \u2013 it was so rich in rubber trees that Brazil engineered a dispute over sovereignty and sent The first coins in the \nAmericas were minted in Potos\u00ed.\n06-history-bol7.indd   24 06-history-bol7.indd   24 8/12/09   09:32:48 8/12/09   09:32:48", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fb33661-ad09-4d04-9153-d56bb9f2b800": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fb33661-ad09-4d04-9153-d56bb9f2b800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d47d0de4-42e7-4d2f-8b4c-7c72ce24b120", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "30aff5b628de6de0c3ae3af22a4dac744cc23dc70d3d10367693e799cbffddf6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\nThe War of the Pacific, in which \nBolivia loses her coastline to Chile, is a sore point to this day that the government uses as a rallying cry to unite the people behind a common cause.1879\u201384 1903 1932\nDuring the rubber boom, Brazil annexes the remote Acre area, which stretched from Bolivia\u2019s present Amazonian borders tohalfway up Peru\u2019s eastern border.Brazil\u2019s promise to build a railroadinto Bolivia was never kept.Bolivia enters the Chaco War \nagainst Paraguay over a borderdispute for control of the potentially huge deposits of oil eyed by rival foreign oil companies.

Brazil then convinced the Acre region to secede from the \nBolivian republic, and promptly annexed it.\nThere were two separate territory losses to Argentina. First, Argentina \nannexed a large slice of the Chaco in 1862. Then, in 1883, the territory \nof Puna de Atacama also went to Argentina. It had been offered to both Chile and Argentina, the former in exchange for return of the Litoral, the latter in exchange for clarification over Bolivia\u2019s ownership of Tarija.\nAfter losing the War of the Pacific, Bolivia was desperate to have the \nChaco, an inhospitable region beneath which rich oilfields were mooted to lie, as an outlet to the Atlantic via the R\u00edo Paraguay. Between 1932 and 1935, a particularly brutal war was waged between Bolivia and Paraguay over the disputed territory (more than 80,000 lives were lost). Though no decisive victory was reached, both nations had grown weary of fighting, and peace negotiations in 1938 awarded most of the disputed territory to Paraguay. \nCONTINUING POLITICAL STRIFE\nDuring the 20th century wealthy tin barons and landowners controlled Bolivian farming and mining interests, while the peasantry was relegated to a feudal system of peonage known as pongaje . The beating Bolivia \ntook in the Chaco War made way for reformist associations, civil unrest among the cholos  (indigenous people who dress traditionally but live in \ncities) and a series of coups by reform-minded military leaders.\nThe most significant development was the emergence of the Movimiento \nNacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) political party. They united the masses behind the common cause of popular reform, sparking friction between peasant miners and absentee tin bosses. The miners\u2019 complaints against outrageous working conditions, pitifully low pay and the export of profits to Europe raised the political consciousness of all Bolivian workers. Under the leadership of V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro (commonly re-ferred to as V\u00edctor Paz), the MNR prevailed in the 1951 elections, but a last-minute military coup prevented it from actually taking power. What ensued was a period of serious combat, which ended with the defeat of the military and Paz Estensorro\u2019s rise to power. He immediately nation-alized mines, evicted the tin barons, put an end to pongaje  and set up \nComibol (Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia), the state entity in charge of mining interests.\nThe miners and peasants felt they were being represented, enabling \nthe MNR to stay in power for 12 years under various leaders. But even with US support, the MNR was unable to raise the standard of living or increase food production substantially. Its effectiveness and popularity ground to a halt and V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro was forced to become increas-ingly autocratic; in 1964 his government was overthrown by a military junta headed by General Ren\u00e9 Barrientos Ortu\u00f1o.The Chaco War (1932\u2013\n35) between Bolivia and Paraguay inspired several books, including Aluvi\u00f3n de fuego  (1935) \nby Oscar Cerruto, Sangre \nde mestizos  (1936) by \nAugusto C\u00e9spedes and Laguna  (1938) by Costa \ndu Rels.\nIn 1935, just over a century after Bolivia\u2019s independence, Bolivia had lost more than half of its territory.\n06-history-bol7.indd   25 06-history-bol7.indd   25 8/12/09   09:32:48 8/12/09   09:32:48", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe0ffd51-b29f-422a-b820-b4c9ab6bc765": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe0ffd51-b29f-422a-b820-b4c9ab6bc765", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3337e2ff-f2da-4141-a0b4-4c55b4878b24", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "6181647c39d8b4a4c415e6fc983f1ad5d865a46f2bce9e96a8557b88919a8d5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\n1935\nA ceasefire in the Chaco War is \nnegotiated on June 10, 1335, at which time Paraguay controls much of the region.

Right-wing coalition leader General Hugo Banzer Su\u00e1rez eventually took over in 1971 and served a turbulent term through 1978, punctuated by reactionary extremism and human-rights abuses. \nThe next three years were filled with failed elections, appointed presi-\ndents, military coups and hideous regimes, and a rash of tortures, arrests and disappearances, as well as a marked increase in cocaine production and trafficking. \nIn 1982 Congress elected Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo, the civilian left-wing \nleader of the Communist-supported Movimiento de la Izquierda Revolu-cionaria (MIR). His term was beleaguered with labor disputes, ruthless government spending and huge monetary devaluation, resulting in a truly staggering inflation rate that at one point reached 35,000% annually.\nWhen Siles Zuazo gave up after three years and called general elec-\ntions, V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro returned to politics to become president for the fourth time. He immediately enacted harsh measures to revive the shattered economy: he ousted labor unions, removed government restrictions on internal trade, slashed the government deficit, imposed a wage freeze, eliminated price subsidies, laid off workers at inefficient government-owned companies, allowed the peso to float against the US dollar and deployed armed forces to keep the peace.\nInflation was curtailed within weeks, but spiraling unemployment, \nespecially in the poor Altiplano mining areas, caused enormous suf-fering and threatened the government\u2019s stability. Throughout his term, however, Paz Estenssoro remained committed to programs that would return the government mines to private cooperatives and develop the largely uninhabited lowland regions. To encourage the settlement of the Amazon, he promoted road building (with Japanese aid) in the wilder-ness and opened up vast indigenous lands and pristine rainforest to logging interests.\nCHAOS PREVAILS \nFree from the threat of military intervention, the 1989 presidential elec-tions were characterized mostly by apathy. Hugo Banzer Su\u00e1rez of the Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica Nacionalista (ADN) resurfaced, the MIR nominated Jaime Paz Zamora and the MNR put forth mining company president and economic reformist Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada (\u2018Goni\u2019). Although Banzer and S\u00e1nchez were placed ahead of Paz Zamora, no candidate received a majority, so it was left to the National Congress to select a winner. Congress selected Paz Zamora as the new president (meanwhile, rivals Banzer and Paz Zamora formed a coalition). The Paz Zamora presidency, while generally peaceful and fairly successful, introduced no major changes to the political climate.Keen Ch\u00e9 Guevara fans \nshould definitely grab a copy of Ch\u00e9 Guevara: \na Revolutionary Life  \n(Bantam Press, 1997).\n06-history-bol7.indd   26 06-history-bol7.indd   26 8/12/09   09:32:49 8/12/09   09:32:49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3557, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e76a699a-b05c-45db-86af-a50427b2da53": {"__data__": {"id_": "e76a699a-b05c-45db-86af-a50427b2da53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30f5c848-cc18-4698-9885-6966509bcf08", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "04a4d5cd8128ee1da7e3ce0b0adcad626fede1f6279963f8c9016b894decb2f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\nAfter trying and failing for \ntwelve years to raise the standard of living and increase food production, the MNR\u2019s popularity wanes, and Victor Paz\u2019 government is finally forced out by a military junta. 1964 1967 1978\nArgentine revolutionary Ernesto \u2018Ch\u00e9\u2019 Guevara, having failed to foment a peasant revolt in Bolivia, is executed by a US-backed military squad in the hamlet of La Higuera.Hugo Banzer Su\u00e1rez schedules \ngeneral elections and loses.

HISTORY  \u2022\u2022  Chaos Prevails   27\nIn the 1993 election, S\u00e1nchez was elected. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Aymar\u00e1 running \nmate, Victor Hugo C\u00e1rdenas, appealed to cholos  and campesinos  (subsist-\nence farmers), while European urbanites embraced S\u00e1nchez\u2019s free-market economic policies. This administration attacked corruption and began imple menting capitalizaci\u00f3n  by opening up state-owned companies and \nmining interests to overseas investment. Officials hoped privatization would stabilize and streamline companies, making them profitable. Overseas investors in formerly state-owned companies received 49% equity, total voting control, license to operate in Bolivia and up to 49% of the profits. The remaining 51% of the shares were distributed to Bolivians as pensions and through Participaci\u00f3n Popular, a program meant to channel spending away from cities and into rural schools, clinics and other local infrastructure.\nIn late 1995, reform issues were overshadowed by violence and un-\nrest surrounding US-directed coca eradication in the Chapare. Even the establishment of a Spanish-managed private pension scheme and a subsequent payment of US$248 to each Bolivian pensioner \u2013 with the promise of future payments from the less-than-fluid plan \u2013 did little to boost the administration\u2019s popularity.\nIn 1997 voters, upset by the reforms, cast 22.5% of the ballot in favor \nof comeback king and former dictator General Hugo Banzer Su\u00e1rez. Congress deemed Banzer the victor, and he was sworn in on August 6 to a five-year term, up from four by a 1996 constitutional amendment. \nIn the late 1990s Banzer faced swelling public discontent with his \ncoca eradication measures and widespread corruption, and unrest in response to increasing gas prices, a serious water shortage and economic downturn in the department of Cochabamba. In 2000, public protests over increasing gas prices versus government-controlled transportation fares resulted in the blockade of the Yungas Highway for several weeks, and several issues inspired marches, demonstrations and occasional violence, which sporadically halted all traffic (in some cases even vendor and pedestrian traffic) in La Paz and other cities. \nFollowing a successful campaign advised by a team of US political \nconsultants that he hired, \u2018Goni\u2019 S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was appointed presi-dent in August 2002. In February 2003 his International Monetary Fund (IMF)-endorsed economic policies, including steep tax hikes and the exportation of gas out of Bolivia for processing elsewhere, were met with widespread demonstrations and the loss of 67 lives during a police lock-down in La Paz. In October 2003, Goni resigned amidst massive popular protests and fled back to the States, where he lives today in Maryland. Bolivia\u2019s government accused Goni and 16 members of his cabinet for the deaths caused by the military crackdown in 2003. In 2008 the request for extradition was formally served to the US government but has so far been unheeded. The trial opened in La Paz in May 2009 in absentia, with only eight of 17 accused politicians in attendance. \nGoni was the first \nBolivian president to have introduced \u2018shock therapy\u2019, an economic theory introduced by Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs used to drastically cut hyperinflation in a short period of time.\n06-history-bol7.indd   27 06-history-bol7.indd   27 8/12/09   09:32:49 8/12/09   09:32:49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dad4d452-d6ba-4b42-b038-108eff686c62": {"__data__": {"id_": "dad4d452-d6ba-4b42-b038-108eff686c62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0cadcbd9-1894-4e8a-bd7a-e42977e20905", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "dde93d7935e3c90446c8d871d7c8e3099507b149c914c5eb1163671caf9e4e9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\n1982\nThe Bolivian Congress \nappointed a woman, Lidia Gueilar, as interim president during the tumultuous period of several presidential elections and coups.

The culture clash is simple: the West sees coca as a raw product in the manufacturing of an addictive drug; the indigenous peoples of the Andes view it as a sacred crop that has sustained them for centuries in its unprocessed form. The government estimates that as many as 1.2 million kilos of coca leaf are consumed monthly in Bolivia for traditional uses such as chewing the leaf, drinking it in mate  and using it \nin religious ceremonies. In fact, its mild alkaloids are said to provide an essential barrier against altitude sickness and fatigue for farm workers and miners in the highlands.\nMorales\u2019 hard-line stance against the 1990s\u2019 US-led Plan Dignidad (a coca eradication program) \nwon him some political battle scars; intransigence on both sides led to the loss of many lives, cocaleros  (coca growers) and soldiers alike, in the Chapare region. Morales continues to claim that \nthe West should confront the demand for cocaine in the developed world (at his first address to the UN, he held up a coca leaf, remarking that it was green, not white).\nIn the new constitution, Morales declared coca an intrinsic part of Bolivia\u2019s heritage and \nAndean culture. Following the expulsion of the US ambassador in September 2008, the US State Department placed Bolivia on its \u2018drug blacklist\u2019 for their unwillingness to cooperate on the drug trafficking problem. In retaliation, Morales suspended the activities of the US Drug Enforcement Agency in Bolivia. At a UN meeting in March 2009, he announced that Bolivia would start the process to remove the coca leaf from the 1961 Single Convention that prohibits the traditional chewing of coca leaf. Evo has been hard at work attempting to establish a new industry of legal coca-based by-products such as tea, medicines and cosmetics, in hopes of creating a growing market and boosting the income of coca growers. Some see this as opting out of the war on drugs. But, using the motto \u2018coca yes, cocaine no\u2019, he has cracked down on illegal drugs; in April 2009, a new anti-corruption unit was established in Bolivia mainly to fight drug trafficking and related crime.\nFor more on coca, see p298.The earliest references to the use of the coca leaf is found in chulpas  \n(mummies) in north Peru (2500\u20131800 BC).\n06-history-bol7.indd   28 06-history-bol7.indd   28 8/12/09   09:32:49 8/12/09   09:32:49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4023, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63208c8d-a3d5-476a-b797-c55d384933ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "63208c8d-a3d5-476a-b797-c55d384933ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2420ca1f-cb38-4aa1-9068-dbd27a159911", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "15fe4cc34fbca62d10cfa02ea531b9371d9ab6bf9c5c9b302c107b3c85e36c29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\nWith no candidate winning \na majority in the presidential election, the National Congress is left to select Jaime Paz Zamora of the MIR as the 73rd President of Bolivia.1989 1993 1995\nGonzalo S\u00e1nchez is elected president on a centre-left free-marketeering ticket and, with his government, proceeds to introduce landmark social, economic and constitutional reforms.Labor grievances over the new \nprivatization policies result in a 90-day state-of-siege declara-tion and the arrest of 374 labor leaders.

In January 2009, the new socially-focused constitution was approved by 67% of voters in a nationwide referendum. The first constitution in Bolivia approved by popular vote, it gave greater power to the country\u2019s indigenous majority and allowed Morales to seek a second five-year term. For the first time in Bolivia\u2019s history, the 36 formerly marginalised groups were granted the right to territory, language and community justice. Echoing the land reform bill passed by the Senate in November 2006, the constitution also limited the size of landholdings in order to redistribute Bolivia\u2019s land from large ranchers and landowners to poor indigenous farmers, and to promote social and economic equality. \nBOLIVIA SPLITS OVER EVO\nHaving redefined indigenous identity and empowered the underprivi-leged majority in a land where \u2018Indio\u2019  (Indian) is still a common insult, \nEvo has near-universal support among the indigenous people of Bolivia. But his radical social changes aren\u2019t without resistance. In the eastern part of the country, in the four departments known as La Media Luna (Half Moon, for their geographic shape), where much of the natural resources lie, a strong right-wing opposition has been standing up to Morales, often accusing him of being an ethnocentric despot. Since 2006, there have been a series of violent protests sweeping the four lowland provinces \u2013 these culminated with street battles in Santa Cruz in September 2008, killing 11 people and wounding 50 in a clash between anti-government activists and the military troops sent in to guard natural gas pipelines to ensure continued export to Brazil and Argentina. Sparked by Evo\u2019s attempts to redirect gas revenues of the energy-rich eastern provinces to the poor highlands, the conflict also rests on the other sore point for La Media Luna \u2013 the new constitution, particularly for its land reform and for allowing Morales to run for re-election. \nThe polarization in Bolivia is very real, with the province of Santa Cruz \nconstantly requesting more autonomy and threatening to secede from the Tune into Our Brand in \nCrisis  (2005), Rachel \nBoynton\u2019s documentaryabout a team of high-profile US political consultants hired to market the 2002 election campaign of Gonzalo \u2018Goni\u2019 S\u00e1nchez de Lozada.\n06-history-bol7.indd   29 06-history-bol7.indd   29 8/12/09   09:32:49 8/12/09   09:32:49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "054a6c22-5b6d-47e3-bdff-9826bcec4181": {"__data__": {"id_": "054a6c22-5b6d-47e3-bdff-9826bcec4181", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11706958-38ba-465d-8cbd-cdac6bb821aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "10ad9474c90f3ed09c0830d54ad0f10423590ea5e14ee3ca72eadc3f93837609", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\nThe World Bank forces the \nBolivian government to sell Cochabamba\u2019s\n water utility \nto the private US-company Bechtel.

However, Morales has been surprisingly successful in \npushing his initiatives through despite the fervent opposition. Following the September 2008 protests, he even expelled the US ambassador, Philip S Goldberg, reproaching him for fuelling the right-wing separatists. \nIn April 2009, more opposition drama ensued as Morales and his \nideological allies went on a five-day hunger strike to protest the opposi-tion minority in the Senate that tried to sabotage the new constitution by reducing the number of indigenous seats in the Assembly. Despite the opposition leaders calling this hunger strike \u2018political blackmail\u2019, the Congress did pass the law guaranteeing 14 congressional seats and al-lowing expatriates the right to vote in the general elections in December 2009. Soon after, an elite police force shot dead three men in Santa Cruz who reportedly tried to assassinate Morales. He later implied that this thwarted murder plot was linked to the recent vote in Congress and his expulsion of the American ambassador. \nWhile popular with the traditionally oppressed \u2018little people\u2019 who \nhave been in the shadows throughout Bolivia\u2019s history, Morales has seriously alienated the hard-working businessmen and industrialists BOLIVIA: SET TO BECOME THE SAUDI ARABIA OF LITHIUM?\nBolivia holds the key to an environmentally sustainable future \u2013 50% of the world\u2019s lithium \ndeposits (about 5.4 million tonnes), a mineral essential for hybrid and electric vehicles, is found in the salt flats of Uyuni. Unlike metals such as lead, nickel and cobalt traditionally used in batteries, lithium is energy efficient and quickly rechargeable. Lithium-ion batteries already power mobile phones, digital cameras and laptops. \nSeveral major players in the global auto industry have their eyes set on this untapped poten-\ntial. And while Bolivia\u2019s previous governments would have happily sold off its lithium reserves to foreign companies, it\u2019s not going to happen under Evo Morales. He takes a firm stand on this topic: Bolivia\u2019s natural bounty will not be subject to foreign exploitation again, like the plundering that occurred with silver, gold and tin. Instead, the idea is to maximize the benefits for Bolivian people. Faithful to his anti-capitalist rhetoric, he has continually rejected bids from international mining companies and, so far, successfully warded off outside involvement in this precious mineral. With an investment of US$6 million, Comibol, the state agency that oversees mining projects, is currently constructing a pilot plant in the salt flats, slated to produce about 1.2 kilotonnes per year at first, to be increased to 30 kilotonnes by 2012. \nCar manufacturers predict that the world will need 500 kilotonnes per year to service a niche \nmarket, with that figure to rise if electric cars become the norm. If the demand for eco-vehicles does rise, the world\u2019s supply of lithium will be outstripped by 2015. Critics claim that Bolivia doesn\u2019t have the technology to extract lithium quickly and efficiently enough, which may thwart its plans to become the Saudi Arabia of lithium. State control over the lithium reserves may be a good social move in order to lift Bolivians out of poverty and keep the wealth inside the country. Whether it\u2019s a practical move remains to be seen. \n06-history-bol7.indd   30 06-history-bol7.indd   30 8/12/09   09:32:49 8/12/09   09:32:49", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbae12a0-5097-46b9-88b0-4e8d472476c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbae12a0-5097-46b9-88b0-4e8d472476c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "280a091c-1b44-4acf-b815-0f83296555f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "5a209aaea5f270d39cc17bd50e68ab83da0d99460839961e117426518356c9a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com\nOn August 6, Bolivia\u2019s \nIndependence Day, the Morales-created National Constituent Assembly, sits for the first time.

Cambas  (lowlanders) \nand kollas (highlanders) enjoy expounding on what makes them different \n(ie better) than the other. Lowlanders are said to be warmer, more casual and more generous to strangers; highlanders are supposedly harder work-ing but less open-minded. While the jesting used to be good-natured, regional tensions have increased over the past few years, with Santa Cruz\u2019s threats of succession constantly in the news. \nOver the last 30 years, the Aymar\u00e1 (a cultural group of highlanders and \ndescendents of the Tiwanaku empire) in particular have increasingly embraced their ethnicity with pride and their status has increased with economic success, mostly in the urban areas. In La Paz, there has been a resurgence of traditional Aymar\u00e1 dress among some younger women (see p37 for more on this phenomenon). So strong are the trends that the annual contest to elect a Miss Cholita Pace\u00f1a is attracting con testants who have ditched their designer jeans in favor of new-found cholita  fashions and \nstatus. The image of the chola  (a city-dwelling Aymar\u00e1 woman who wears \ntraditional dress; \u2018cholita\u2019  is sometimes considered more polite) is alter-\ning dramatically. The traditional image of a market trader is rapidly being superseded by that of a businesswoman or politician (there are even cholas  \nin government); her attitudes and behavior are said to represent the contemporary Aymar\u00e1 bourgeoisie. See p36 for more on Bolivian women.\nBolivian identity and national psyche have been in a state of flux over the \nlast few years. Thanks in part to Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, Evo Morales, many Bolivians have been \u2018redefining\u2019 and even questioning what it means to be Bolivian. From the beginning, Morales vigorously stressed that Bolivian identity was based on an individual\u2019s ethnic origins. Despite his claims that all Bolivians were equal, Morales was quick to espouse the status of indigenous groups. Some accuse him of political maneuvering and of polarizing the country according to race, class, economic status and skin color. He has been seen as favoring indigenous groups over Bolivian and foreign \u2018whites\u2019 and mestizos who, as descendants of the Spanish colonists and indigenous people, are rightly proud of their Bolivian status. \nAt a social level, Bolivians are keen on greetings and pleasantries. Every \nexchange is kicked off with the usual Buen d\u00eda  or Buenos d\u00edas (Good \nmorning) , but also with a \u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1?  or \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal?  (How are you?). \nBolivian Spanish is also liberally sprinkled with endearing diminutives referring to everyday items such as sopita  (a little soup) and pesitos  (little \npesos, as in \u2018it only costs 10 little pesos\u2019).\nBolivians are extremely proud of their regional foods and cultural \npractices, including dances. In fact, most Bolivians love any excuse to festejar  (party).\nCollectively, Bolivians have a landlocked longing for the sea and \nunerringly mark El D\u00eda del Mar (Day of the Sea) to commemorate the Chilean annexation of Bolivia\u2019s only stretch of coastline on March 24, 1879, during the War of the Pacific. \nLIFESTYLE \nDay-to-day life varies from Bolivian to Bolivian, mostly depending on whether they live in the city or in the country.

Bolivia suffers from a Third World trifecta: a high infant mortality rate (45 deaths per 1000 births), a reasonably high birth rate (3.17 per woman) and a low literacy rate (86.7%). \nOverall, 87% of primary school-aged children are enrolled in classes, \nbut attendance isn\u2019t necessarily a high priority. On the higher-education front there are 30 universities in the country, 10 of which are public. The growing ranks of well-educated college graduates are frustrated by the lack of domestic employment opportunities and are increasingly seek-ing work abroad, especially in Spain, Argentina and the US. However, a positive push toward educating the indigenous populations was made by the Morales government when they announced the opening of three indigenous universities (for Aymar\u00e1s, Quechuas and Guaran\u00eds) in April 2009, in order to boost intercultural and multi-language exchange.\nSince Morales rose to power, he has put an accent on improving \nthe social welfare system, funded largely by profits generated by the nationalization of the country\u2019s natural gas reserves. There are now stipends for primary education and food vouchers for the elderly and children. However, this has been far from smooth sailing, and the disabled, mentally ill and underemployed still sometimes take to the streets, hoping to arouse sympathy. One ethnic group in the department of Potos\u00ed is known to have organized a begging syndicate; they send older women into larger cities around the country, provide accommodations and supply them with suitably grubby-looking children.\nIn the highlands, the concept of ayllu , the traditional peasant com-\nmune that dates back to the Inca times, is still very much linked to Bolivia\u2019s close-knit families of today. These sociopolitical structures were extended family groups that worked the land together. In some ways, this concept still exists today, with old people predominantly provided for by their relatives. Evo often refers to the concept of ayllu  in his speeches, \nthus promoting community values. \nHomosexuality is legal in Bolivia but isn\u2019t openly flaunted in this so-\nciety of machismo. Despite a growing number of gay bars in some larger cities, gay culture remains fairly subtle. For more details, see p333.\nECONOMY \nDespite its rich natural resources, Bolivia is one of the poorest countriesin Latin America. Estimates put 64% of the population below the poverty line; this figure goes up to 80% in rural areas. The average annual earnings is around US$900 and GDP is around US$36 billion or US$3937 THE CULTURE  \u2022\u2022  Economy   33\nIn 2006, US software \ngiant Microsoft launched its Windows and Office software in the Quechua language.\nARE YOU LOST, MY FRIEND?\nRather than give no response at all, some Bolivians will provide you with incorrect answers or directions. They\u2019re not being malicious; they merely want to appear helpful and knowledge-able. It\u2019s also worth remembering that street numbers are hardly used \u2013 people give directions by landmarks instead.

Current inflation is around 8.7% and the \nunemployment rate is 7.5%.\nBolivia\u2019s main exports include natural gas (with Argentina and Brazil as \nthe main buyers) and zinc. The country\u2019s agricultural products include soy-beans (also a major export), coffee, sugar, cotton, corn and timber. Coca,sunflower seed (for oil) and organic chocolate are also growing industries.\nThere is widespread underemployment; a large percentage of the \nunderemployed supplement their income by participating in the informal street-market economy, which employs more than 60% of the work-force and involves large amounts of contraband. Street vendors seem to be omnipresent all over Bolivia, hawking anything from medicine to art works and household machines. Coca production, mainly in the Yungas and the Chapare, provides subsistence for about 10% of Bolivia\u2019s working population. \nStriking and protests have been part of the socio-economic landscape \nfor years, although the tables have turned more recently and instead of coca farmers and poor highland workers, it\u2019s now the wealthy landowners and industrialist elites of the lowland regions who are displeased. Political change is still a fact of life in Bolivia; some locals have felt that this has been more damaging than constructive to the economy.\nWith the nationalization of natural gas reserves in 2006, Bolivia has \nbeen relying more on its own resources than on foreign aid and keeping the profits in the hands of the Bolivian people. If managed well, Bolivia\u2019s untapped lithium reserves could prove to become a boost to the economy; see p30.\nMost recent UNICEF child-labor data reports that 21% of Bolivian \nchildren aged five to 14 are working to support themselves and their families, a staggering total of 850,000 young people. Most work in the mines or in the streets as lustrabotas  (shoe-shiners) who have become \nubiquitous in larger cities (they make a meagre B$10 per day at best). \nDespite the agrarian reform agenda that Morales has been pushing \nsince his election, forced labor is still very present in the lowlands where landowners hire the indigenous people to work the land under appalling conditions \u2013 workers are given food, the cost of which is then deducted from the average daily wage of B$15. \nPOPULATION\nBolivia is thinly populated, with around 9.8 million people occupying approximately 1,098,580 sq km. The Altiplano supports nearly 70% of the population \u2013 despite its frigid climate and frequently simmering social and political strife \u2013 mostly in the La Paz, Lake Titicaca and Oruro regions. \nBolivia has 36 identified indigenous groups, but there are varying \nfigures regarding the indigenous population. According to the 2001 national census, about half of Bolivia\u2019s population claims indigenous heritage, while most sociologists and anthropologists cite figures of just over 60%. A mere 1% is of African heritage, mostly descendants of slaves conscripted to work in the Potos\u00ed mines (see p131). The remainder of Bolivia\u2019s citizens are largely of European extraction. Not all are descend-ants of the early Spanish conquerors; there are some Mennonite colonies, Jewish refugees from Nazi Europe, Eastern European refugees and hordes of researchers, aid workers and missionaries. Small Middle Eastern and Asian minorities, consisting mainly of Palestinians, Punjabis, Japanese and Chinese, have also immigrated. \nThe vast majority of those who identify themselves as indigenous are \nAymar\u00e1 (about 25%) and Quechua (about 30%), many of whom are The Fat Man from La Paz: \nContemporary Fiction from Bolivia,  edited by Rosario \nSantos, is a collection of 20 short stories offering perspectives about typical Bolivians and their lives.\nThe Wiphala flag (square-shaped and consisting of 49 small squares in a grid with graduating colors of the rainbow) has been adopted as a symbol of the Aymar\u00e1 people.

The remaining groups (including Guaran\u00ed and \nChiquitano) are located almost entirely in the lowlands.\nSPORTS \nLike its Latin American neighbors, Bolivia\u2019s national sport is f\u00fatbol  \n(soccer). La Paz\u2019s Bol\u00edvar and The Strongest usually participate (albeitweakly) in the Copa Libertadores, the annual showdown of Latin America\u2019s top clubs. Bolivian teams typically fare well in futsal  or f\u00fatbol   \nde salon  (five-vs-five mini-soccer) world championships. Professional \nf\u00fatbol  matches are held every weekend in big cities, and impromptu \nstreet games are always happening. While small towns lack many basic services, you can be sure to find a well-tended cancha  (football field) \nalmost everywhere you go \u2013 and you\u2019ll be welcome to join in. Some communities still bar women from the field, but in the Altiplano, women\u2019s teams have started popping up, where they play clad in polleras  \n(skirts) and jerseys. There is a national women\u2019s team, and the game is becoming more popular among females.\nSeveral times a year La Paz locals put aside concerns about the weather, \nthe price of tickets and other worldly matters for a game that\u2019s guaranteed to swell the Hernando Siles (Map pp68-9) soccer stadium to its near 50,000 capacity: El Cl\u00e1sico, the showdown between La Paz\u2019s (and the nation\u2019s) two big f\u00fatbol  teams, Bol\u00edvar and The Strongest. The intracity \nrivalry stretches back more than a quarter-century, to Club Bol\u00edvar\u2019s founding in 1925 (The Strongest are the country\u2019s oldest team, started in 1908). The Strongest (nicknamed the \u2018Tigres\u2019 for their bold yellow-and-black striped uniform) have more support in the working-class and poorer neighborhoods, while the \u2018Celestes\u2019 of Club Bol\u00edvar (dubbed for their sky-blue uniforms) are more of a rich-man\u2019s team. \nEl Alto is home to the rough-and-ready, athletic and extremely choreo-\ngraphed \u2018free-style\u2019 lucha libre (wrestling matches). Less of a sport and \nmore an entertainment for audience voyeurs, \u2018good guy\u2019 and \u2018bad guy\u2019 wrestlers fight it out in the ring wearing outfits that Superman and Spiderman would envy. More recently, much to the delight of the crowds, women have joined the fray, some dressed as innocent looking cholitas,  \nothers in devilish costumes. Anything goes, from eye gouging to head-locks and, occasionally, dwarf-throwing (not for the politically correct or sensitive viewer). See p73 for more details.\nIn rural communities, volleyball is a sunset affair, with mostly adults \nplaying a couple of times a week. Racquetball, billiards, chess and cacho  \n(dice) are also popular. The unofficial national sport, however, has to be feasting and feting \u2013 the competition between dancers and drinkers knows no bounds.\nRELIGION\nRoughly 95% of Bolivia\u2019s population professes Roman Catholicism and practices it to varying degrees. The remaining 5% are Protestant, agnostic and belonging to other religions. Strong evangelical movementsare rapidly gaining followers with their fire-and-brimstone messages of the world\u2019s imminent end. Despite the political and economic strength of Western religions, it\u2019s clear that most religious activities have mixed Inca and Aymar\u00e1 belief systems with Christianity. Doctrines, rites and superstitions are commonplace, and some campesinos  still live by a \ntraditional lunar calendar.\nBased on animism, indigenous religions believe in natural gods and \nspirits, which date back to Inca times and earlier. Pachamama, the The Aymar\u00e1 and Quechua \nspiritual worlds embrace three levels: Alajpacha (the world above or eternal sky, representing light and life, the center or the earthly world); Akapacha (located between the sky and hell, and between life and death); and Mankapacha (located below, symbolizing death and obscurity). \n07-the-culture-bol7.indd   35 07-the-culture-bol7.indd   35 8/12/09   09:27:13 8/12/09   09:27:13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3904, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd578bab-1ed0-4318-a09c-9a5ada9c2c1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd578bab-1ed0-4318-a09c-9a5ada9c2c1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e663b9a7-40dd-4918-afc7-9008532a5662", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "7555673cdb340f876b2fd4fe4765ca2ff296060e41ef2a0634987f2cf81c46f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com 36   THE CULTURE  \u2022\u2022  Women in Bolivia\nubiquitous earth mother, is the most popular recipient of sacrificial \nofferings, since she shares herself with human beings, helps bring forth crops and distributes riches to those she favors. She has quite an appetite for coca, alcohol and the blood of animals, particularly white llamas. If you\u2019re wondering about all the llama fetuses in the markets, they are wrapped up and buried under new constructions, especially homes, as an offering to Pachamama.\nAmong the Aymar\u00e1 and Quechua mountain gods, the apus  and \nachachilas  are important. The apus,  mountain spirits who provide \nprotection for travelers, are often associated with a particular nevado  \n(snowcapped peak). Illimani, for example, is an apu who looks over \ninhabitants of La Paz. Achachilas  are spirits of the high mountains; \nbelieved to be ancestors of the people, they look after their ayllu  (loosely \ntranslated as \u2018tribe\u2019) and provide bounty from the earth. \nEkeko, which means \u2018dwarf\u2019 in Aymar\u00e1, is the jolly little household god \nof abundance. Since he\u2019s responsible for matchmaking, finding homes for the homeless and ensuring success for businesspeople, he\u2019s well looked \nafter, especially during the Alasitas festival in La Paz (p76).\nTalismans are also used in daily life to encourage prosperity or to \nprotect a person from evil. A turtle is thought to bring health, a frog or toad carries good fortune, an owl signifies wisdom and success in school, and a condor will ensure a good journey. \nWOMEN IN BOLIVIA\nMachismo is alive and well in Bolivia, but women\u2019s rights and education organizations are popping up, most notably in El Alto, and in the strong activist women\u2019s movement Mujeres Creando (www.mujerescreando.org) in La Paz. Women began to play a role in the political arena back in 1982 when the Bolivian congress appointed a woman as interim president. Then, in 1989, Remedios Loza became the first indigenous woman who sat in Congress. Today, under the Morales government, many women, including cholas,  have been elected as members of the 2006 national \nlegislature and as representatives to the Constitutional Assembly. \nMore recently, a new lingo has emerged to describe Bolivian cholas,  \nwhose status, thanks partly to the support of the indigenous president, is increasing. While the chola  is a woman who wears traditional dress \n(see opposite), the chota  is a woman who has ditched her chola  dress and \nconverted to Western-style dress, a birlocha  is a Western-style woman who\nopposes the chola,  and \u2018 chola  transformers\u2019 are females who assume the role \nof cholas  when they feel like it, such as in cultural events and fiestas.FIESTA DE LAS \u00d1ATITAS\nOne of the most bizarre and fascinating Aymar\u00e1 rituals is the Fiesta de las \u00d1atitas  (Festival of \nSkulls), which is celebrated one week after Day of the Dead. \u00d1atitas  (skulls) are presented at \nthe cemetery chapel in La Paz to be blessed by a Catholic priest. Parish priests shy away from associating this rite with mass, but have begrudgingly recognized the custom. The skulls are adorned with offerings of flowers, candles and coca leaves, and many even sport sunglasses and a lit cigarette between their teeth. While some people own the skulls of deceased loved ones and friends (who they believe are watching over them), many anonymous craniums are believed to have been purchased from morgues and (so it is claimed) medical faculties. After the blessings, the decorated \u00f1atitas  are carted back to the owners\u2019 houses to bring good luck \nand protection. This ancient Aymar\u00e1n ritual was practiced in secret but, nowadays, the chapel\u2019s head count is growing every year.\n07-the-culture-bol7.indd   36 07-the-culture-bol7.indd   36 8/12/09   09:27:13 8/12/09   09:27:13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3786, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae6f21be-0e6c-42a3-8344-f32d824f3110": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae6f21be-0e6c-42a3-8344-f32d824f3110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42ef7f80-383e-4c58-938a-c7d7d369228c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "5f95b5b7f99507323aaaf8d73e6d5d4e45a4a59752c2c6c5f86f04b3000feaf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15e56041-b688-48fe-a965-3d406e264f8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb888b0396c81594311e10294a51f3e1b2d7c2b5db83cf2fb1b9e5ec1d21e43c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com THE CULTURE  \u2022\u2022  Arts   37\nARTS\nBolivia is rich in artistic expression, whether it be through music and \ntextiles or film and literature. While traditional music and textiles are more prevalent than contemporary gallery art, La Paz\u2019s Museo de Arte Contemporaneo (p72) represents a growing appreciation of contempo-rary art. The Casa de la Cultura  \n(Map pp68-9; % 2-240-6877;  Mariscal Santa Cruz & Potos\u00ed)  \nin La Paz is an excellent place to view art exhibits, as well as find out information on the art scene. In the way of performances, formal theater is limited to larger cities and traditional pe\u00f1as  (folk-music programs). \nYou can catch lively dance and theatrical performances almost anywhere during festivals and parades. \nTextile weaving methods have changed little in Bolivia for centuries. \nDuring the colonial period, woven cloth was one of the most important tribute items (after gold, silver and other minerals) required by the crown. In rural areas girls learn to weave before they reach puberty, and women spend nearly all their spare time with a drop spindle or weaving on heddle looms. Prior to colonization, llama and alpaca wool were the materials of choice, although now sheep\u2019s wool and synthetic fibers are also prominent.\nBolivian textiles come in diverse patterns. The majority display a \ndegree of skill that results from millennia of artistry and tradition. The most common piece is a manta  or aguayo,  a square shawl made of two \nhandwoven strips joined edge to edge. Also common are the chuspa  (coca \npouch), chullo  (knitted hat), the falda  (skirt), woven belts and touristy \nitems such as camera bags made from remnants.\nRegional differences are manifested in weaving style, motif and use. \nWeavings from Tarabuco often feature intricate zoomorphic patterns, \nCHOLA DRESS\nThe characteristic dress worn by many Bolivian indigenous women was imposed on them in the \n18th century by the Spanish king, and the customary center parting of the hair was the result of a decree by the Viceroy Toledo.\nThis distinctive ensemble, both colorful and utilitarian, has almost become Bolivia\u2019s defining \nimage. The most noticeable characteristic of the traditional Aymar\u00e1 dress is the ubiquitous dark green, black or brown bowler hat. These are not attached with hat pins, but balance on the cholita s\u2019 heads.\nThe women normally braid their hair into two long plaits that are joined by a tuft of black \nwool known as a pocacha . The pollera  skirts they wear are constructed of several horizontal pleats, \nworn over multiple layers of petticoats. Traditionally, only a married woman\u2019s skirt was pleated, while a single female\u2019s was not. Today, most of the synthetic materials for these brightly colored polleras  are imported from South Korea.\nThe women also wear a factory-made blouse, a woolen chompa  (sweater/jumper), a short \nvest-like jacket and a cotton apron, or some combination of these. Usually, they add a shawl known as a manta. Fashion dictates subtleties, such as the length of both the skirt and the \ntassels on the shawl.\nSome sling an aguayo  (also spelled ahuayo ), a rectangle of manufactured or handwoven cloth \ndecorated with colorful horizontal bands, across their backs. It\u2019s used as a carryall and is filled with everything from coca or groceries to babies.\nThe Quechua of the highland valleys wear equally colorful but not so universally recognized \nattire. The hat, called a montera,  is a flat-topped affair made of straw or finely woven white \nwool. It\u2019s often taller and broader than the bowlers worn by the Aymar\u00e1. The felt monteras  (aka \nmorriones ) of Tarabuco, patterned after Spanish conquistadores\u2019 helmets, are the most striking. \nWomen\u2019s skirts are usually made of velour and are shorter in length.Librer\u00eda Boliviana (www.libreriaboliviana.com, in Spanish) stocks an extensive collection of books, videos, traditional instruments and music, and ships worldwide.\nA common petty crime in La Paz is the theft of bowler hats \u2013 valued upwards of US$8 \u2013 from cholitas \u2019 heads in \ncrowded markets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4067, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15e56041-b688-48fe-a965-3d406e264f8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "15e56041-b688-48fe-a965-3d406e264f8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42ef7f80-383e-4c58-938a-c7d7d369228c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "5f95b5b7f99507323aaaf8d73e6d5d4e45a4a59752c2c6c5f86f04b3000feaf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae6f21be-0e6c-42a3-8344-f32d824f3110", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "a03120f2ca5f850d8edf8891a1bd01a7d6f18bff5450c940b82b32f42fbf972b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Quechua of the highland valleys wear equally colorful but not so universally recognized \nattire.

Zoomorphic patterns are also prominent in the wild Charazani country north of Lake Titicaca and in several Altiplano areas outside La Paz, including Lique and Calamarka.\nSome extremely fine weavings originate in Sica Sica, one of the many \ndusty and nondescript villages between La Paz and Oruro, while in Calcha, southeast of Potos\u00ed, expert spinning and an extremely tight weave \u2013more than 150 threads per inch \u2013 produce Bolivia\u2019s finest textiles.\nVicu\u00f1a fibers, the finest and most expensive in the world, are produced \nin Apolobamba and in Sajama National Park.\nMusic \nWhile all Andean musical traditions have evolved from a series of pre-Inca, Inca, Spanish, Amazonian and even African influences, each region of Bolivia has developed distinctive musical traditions, dances and instru ments. The strains of the Andean music from the cold and bleak Altiplano are suitably haunting and mournful, while those of warmer Tarija, with its complement of bizarre musical instruments, take on more vibrant and colorful tones. Original Andean music was exclusively instrumental, but a recent trend toward melody has inspired the addition of appropriately tragic, bittersweet or morose lyrics.\nThe instrument Bolivia is most known for, and understandably \nproud of, is the charango,  considered the king of all stringed instruments. \nModeled after the Spanish vihuela  and mandolin, it gained initial popu-\nlarity in Potos\u00ed during the city\u2019s mining heyday. It has five courses of two strings and is not usually picked, but rather played in a flailing manner, called rasqueado,  much like a banjo. Thanks to conservation efforts, the \ncharango  is no longer made of quirquinchos  (armadillos) or tortoises. \nBolivia hosts two charango  festivals: the biannual Encuentro Inter nacional \ndel Charango, held every other April in different cities, and the annual \nSede Nacional del Charango, a competitive event that takes place every November in Aiquile (near Cochabamba). If you\u2019re there at the time, stop by to see who wins the Golden Charango.\nAnother instrument commonplace in the gringo markets is the  quena,  \na small flute made of cane, bone or ceramic. The instrument predates MARINA N\u00da\u00d1EZ DEL PRADO\nBolivia\u2019s foremost sculptor, Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado, was born on October 17, 1910 in La Paz. From \n1927 to 1929 she studied at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (National School of Fine Arts), and from 1930 to 1938 she worked there as a professor of sculpture and artistic anatomy.\nHer early works were in cedar and walnut, and represented the mysteries of the Andes: \nindigenous faces, groups and dances. From 1943 to 1945 she lived in New York and turned her attentions to Bolivian social themes, including mining and poverty. She later went through a celebration of Bolivian motherhood with pieces depicting indigenous women, pregnant women and mothers protecting their children. Other works dealt largely with Andean themes, some of which took appealing abstract forms. She once wrote, \u2018I feel the enormous good fortune to have been born under the tutelage of the Andes, which express the richness and the cosmic miracle. My art expresses the spirit of my Andean homeland and the spirit of my Aymar\u00e1 people.\u2019\nDuring her long career she held more than 160 exhibitions, which garnered her numerous \nawards, and she received international acclaim from the likes of Pablo Neruda, Gabriela Mistral, Alexander Archipenko and Guillermo Ni\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n. In her later years Marina lived in Lima, Peru, with her husband, Peruvian writer Jorge Falc\u00f3n. She died there in September 1995 at the age of 84.\nSurf the Bolivian Educational & Cultural network\u2019s site www.llajta.org to hear samples of a wide range of traditional and modern Bolivian music.\n07-the-culture-bol7.indd   38 07-the-culture-bol7.indd   38 8/12/09   09:27:14 8/12/09   09:27:14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3961, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d08f925c-dc79-4908-a6c0-0cf211c9971a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d08f925c-dc79-4908-a6c0-0cf211c9971a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e865662f-b4e5-40eb-bd5b-484834a78a3d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "09a8150719735a546b9f98ed5bb190756eedefcdba8c115ad56ad8a197df9b65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com THE CULTURE  \u2022\u2022  Arts   39\nEuropeans by many centuries and the earliest examples, made of stone, \nwere found near Potos\u00ed.

After the Spanish arrived, European dances and those of the African slaves were introduced, resulting in the hybrid dances that now characterize many Bolivian celebrations. Several postcolonial dances were traditionally performed as a satire, making fun of the colonists. This includes the dance of the doctorcitos , who wear small round glasses and \nfake hooked noses, imitating the colonial lawyers. \nThe country\u2019s geography and climate has traditionally influenced the \nstyle and costumes of the different dances \u2013 those in the highlands are generally more melancholy, with more cumbersome costumes than their counterparts in the warmer lowlands. Some costumes can weigh up to 50kg and are worn for more than 10 hours of dancing. Popular pre-Hispanic dances include La Sicuriada, La Morenada and La Tarqueada. The Spanish had some influence on dance, introducing their salon dances, the Cueca and Bailecito; both are still popular in most of Bolivia. They are danced by handkerchief-waving couples, primarily during fiestas.\nThe most unusual and colorful dances are performed at Altiplano \nfestivals. Oruro\u2019s Carnaval draws huge local and international crowds who watch the many fraternidades  (groups) perform most dances, including the \nwell-known Diablada, and Llamerada, Sicuris and Incas. Huge amounts of money are spent on the costumes and it provides an industry in Oruro (see p157). Potos\u00ed is famed for tinku (see p237) , recreating the region\u2019s \ntinku  fight tradition, while La Paz is renowned for La Morenada, which \nre-enacts the dance of African slaves brought to the courts of Viceroy Felipe III. The costumes consist of hooped skirts, shoulder mantles and devilish dark-faced masks adorned with plumes.\nArchitecture\nTiwanaku\u2019s ruined structures and Inca roads, especially around northern La Paz, and the Altiplano architecture in Bolivia, are interesting examples of pre-Colombian architecture. The classic Inca polygonal-cut stones that distinguish many Peruvian sites are rare in Bolivia, found only on Isla del Sol and Isla de la Luna in Lake Titicaca.\nWhile modernization, earthquakes and a depressed economy have \nresulted in the loss of many colonial buildings throughout Bolivia, fine Los Kjarkas are one of the \nbest-known and loved Andean music groups in South America. The group has introduced the world to the sounds of the zampo\u00f1a,  the quena  and \nthe charango .\nVisit www.mamani.com \nto find out more about contemporary Aymar\u00e1 artist Mamani Mamani.\n07-the-culture-bol7.indd   39 07-the-culture-bol7.indd   39 8/12/09   09:27:14 8/12/09   09:27:14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3954, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e1f493c-5494-457a-9545-14d830fb882c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e1f493c-5494-457a-9545-14d830fb882c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e67b051-1792-4506-89dc-ac1237e7c9f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "9c35bd57be65f1017f4c914344af3a4e2326251d68ac78a5016fc4cc5eaf02eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com 40   THE CULTURE  \u2022\u2022  Arts\ncolonial-era houses and street facades survive, notably in Potos\u00ed, Sucre and \nLa Paz. Most remaining colonial buildings, however, are religious, and their styles are divided into several major overlapping periods. Look carefully at church fronts, as they often possess icons of pagan religions that were incorporated by the indigenous artisans trained by European craftsmen.\nRenaissance (1550\u20131650) churches were constructed primarily of \nadobe, with courtyards and massive buttres ses.

See the amazing results at the San Francisco church in La Paz (p71) and San Lorenzo (p233) in Potos\u00ed.\nIn the 18th century, the Jesuits in what is now known as the Beni \nand Santa Cruz lowlands, went off on neoclassical tangents, designing churches with Bavarian rococo and Gothic elements. Their most unusual effort was the bizarre mission church at San Jos\u00e9 de Chiquitos (p290).\nSince the 1950s many modern high-rises have appeared in the major \ncities. Though most are generic, there are some gems. Look for triangular pediments on the rooflines, new versions of the Spanish balcony, and the use of hardwoods of differing hues. The cathedral in Riberalta (p324) sings the contemporary gospel of brick and cedar like nobody\u2019s business.\nNewer modern architecture in La Paz, especially that in Zona Sur, with \nits reflective glass and anything-goes style, leaves much to be desired.\nVisual Arts\nIn the early colonial days Bolivian art was largely inspired by religion, the major contribution being represented by the Escuela Potosina Ind\u00edgena\n. Hallmarks of this tradition include gilded highlights and \ntriangular representations of the Virgin Mary.\nNotable modern artists include Alejandro Mario Yllanes, an Aymar\u00e1 \ntin miner turned engraver and muralist, and Miguel Alandia Pantoja who, in the late 1940s, painted scenes of popular revolution.\nContemporary Aymar\u00e1 artist Roberto Mamani Mamani from the village\nof Tiwanaku strives to portray the true \u2018color\u2019 of the Altiplano \u2013 not the landscape but rather the images that inspire the people. The pace\u00f1o artistGil Imana brings out the stark, cold and isolated nature of life in the Andes, using only tiny splashes of color on drab backgrounds to hint at the underlying vibrancy of the culture.\nOther contemporary artists to look out for are Gaston Ugalde, Edgar \nArandia, Roberto Valcarcel and Patricia Mariaca.\nFilm\nBolivian film includes an impressive list of names and titles that cannot be done justice here. Film buffs should make their way to La Paz\u2019s Cinemateca Boliviana (p85).\nOne of the most important films in Bolivian history is the documentary\nVuelve Sebastiana  (The Return of Sebastiana; 1953), directed by Jorge Ruiz.\nIt follows a group of people in the Altiplano who are facing extinc tion.

Between 1953 and 1966 it was one of the top five producers of film in Latin America. In 1964, Jorge Sanjin\u00e9s took over as manager. After making propaganda films for the government, Sanjin\u00e9s then outraged the govern ment by shooting Ukamau  (And So It Is; 1966), the tale of the rape and murder of an Aymar\u00e1 \nwoman and her mestizo landowner. Today, Sanjin\u00e9s is regarded as the most important director and prolific filmmaker in Bolivian cinema. His 1969 film Yawar Mallku  (The Blood of the Condor) was a controversial affair \nfor its open criticism of US imperialism; it is today considered one of the stellar examples of Latin American militant cinema.\nWorth seeing is the Bolivia episode of Art Wolfe\u2019s Travels to the Edge  \nPBS series, in which the acclaimed photographer travels to the Altiplano.\nAs well as the films listed here, look out for: El Tri\u00e1ngulo del Lago  \n(2000; Mauricio Calder\u00f3n), El Atraco  (2004; Paolo Agazzi), Di Buen d\u00eda \na Pap\u00e1  (Say Good Morning to Dad; 2005; Fernando Vargas), Cocalero  \n(2007; Alejandro Landes) and Alicia en el Pa\u00eds  (2008; Esteban Larra\u00edn). \nOr look out for one of the following:Amargo Mar\n (Bitter Sea; 1984) By highly regarded director Antonio Eguino, looks at the loss of \nBolivia\u2019s coastline to Chile.\nAmerican Visa  (2005; Juan Carlos Valdivia) Tells the story of a Bolivian professor who, on being \ndenied a visa to the US, finds himself involved in a web of unsavory activities.\nDependencia Sexual  (Sexual Dependency; 2003; Rodrigo Bellot) An award-winning film \nfollowing five troubled teenagers and shot in an unconventional split-screen double angle. \nJonas y la Ballena Rosada  (Jonah & the Pink Whale; 1995; Juan Carlos Valdivia) Deals with the \ndrug trade around the Santa Cruz region.\nSayari  (1995; Mela M\u00e1rques) A breakthrough film with an all-indigenous cast and a female director.\nLiterature\nBolivia has an extraordinarily rich literary tradition, starting with the \n19th-century modernist poets, Rub\u00e9n Dario, Ricardo Jaimes Freyre, Gregorio Reynolds and Franz Tamayo. Other notable poets include the 20th-century poet Oscar Cerruto and feminist poet Adela Zamudi (1854\u20131928). Award-winning poet and novelist Yolanda Bedregal (1916\u201399) isstill considered one of the most prolific and important authors in Bolivia.\nIn the 1920s, Bolivian literature developed an indigenous theme, with \nstories such as La Misk\u2019isimi  (\u2018Sweet Mouth\u2019 in Quechua) by Adolfo \nCosta du Rels and La Ch\u2019aska\u00f1awi  (Eyes of Stars) by Carlos Medinaceli. \nThe Chaco War (1932\u201335), between Bolivia and Paraguay, is examined in Aluvi\u00f3n de fuego  (1935), by Oscar Cerruto, Sangre de mestizos  (1936), \nby Augusto C\u00e9spedes, and Laguna (1967) , by Costa du Rels. \nSubversive literature came to the fore in the 1960s with the death of \nCh\u00e9 Guevara in 1967; the best-known publication is Los fundadores del \nalba , by Renato Prado de Oropeza.

While the Bolivian national \ncuisine might not have an international profile, it deserves one, not least for its admirable versatility derived from the country\u2019s staple foods. Most Bolivian cuisine uses the freshest of fresh, locally grown ingredients and, unlike many other countries, Bolivia still produces a large share of its food. While pesticides and synthetic fertilizers are on the rise, many growers still cultivate with age-old practices that minimize the use of these substances. We can thank the central Andes for our potatoes and peanuts \u2013 it\u2019s the center of origin for these important crop plants.\nBolivian diets reflect its regional, ecological and cultural diversity \u2013 \ningredients are particular to where you are. Altiplano fare tends to be starchy and loaded with carbohydrates, while charque  (jerky), rice and \ntropical fruits are popular in the tropics. In the lowlands, fish, fruit and vegetables feature more prominently. \nMeat invariably dominates and is usually accompanied by rice, a \nstarchy tuber (usually potato or oca) and shredded lettuce. Often, the whole affair is drowned by llajhua  (a fiery tomato-based salsa). The soups \nare a specialty and must be consumed as the locals do \u2013 watch how much llajhua  they do (or don\u2019t) add. Learning how to consume Bolivian dishes \nis integral to their enjoyment.\nIn the cities, sophisticated world cuisine has well and truly hit the \nmarket; many restaurants have created delicious fusions of international dishes and local fare. Asian and European restaurants are increasingly prevalent and popular.\nSTAPLES & SPECIALTIES\nDesayuno  (breakfast) consists of little more than coffee and a bread roll, \nand is often followed by a mid-morning street snack such as a salte\u00f1a \n(meat and vegetable pasty), tucumana (an empanada -like pastry) or \nempanada . Restaurants in tourist-oriented towns offer more elaborate \nWestern-style breakfasts. \nLunch is the main meal of the day. Most restaurants offer an almuerzo  \n(set lunch), which consists of soup, a segundo  (main course) and tea or \ncoffee; sometimes you\u2019ll get a salad and dessert as well. Depending on the class of the restaurant, almuerzos  cost anywhere from B$7 to B$30; \nmeals from the \u00e0 la carte menu cost roughly twice as much. La cena,  the \nevening meal, is mostly served \u00e0 la carte. Many highlanders prefer a light te (tea) instead of an evening meal.\nSnacks\nSalte\u00f1as,  tucumanas or empanadas , common streetside snacks, are foot-\nball-shaped and consist of a pastry shell stuffed with juicy, spiced mixturesof meat and vegetables. Each has a distinct flavor and texture. \nOriginating from Salta (Argentina), salte\u00f1as  are crammed with beef or \nchicken, olives, eggs, potatoes, onions, peas, carrots, raisins and sundryspices. The best ones are juicy and dribble all over the place. The tucu-\nmana  has a puffier pastry shell that is filled with a piquant mix of egg, \npotatoes, chicken and onions. Salte\u00f1as  tend to be sweeter, while tucu-\nmanas  pack a spicy punch. Empanadas  have a slightly more bready en-\ncasement that is sometimes deep-fried rather than baked. A cheesey and yuca (manioc or cassava) bun called cu\u00f1ape  is popular in Santa Cruz.

For a hearty snack, try anticuchos (grilled \ncow heart on skewers), served at markets or street stalls.\nSoup\nA large bowl of sopa \u2013 whether vegetarian or meat based \u2013 is the start of \nevery great Bolivian meal. Two of the most popular soups are the deliciousman\u00ed (peanut) soup and chairo, a hearty soup using many Andean \ningredients including chu\u00f1os (freeze-dried potatoes), meat and vegetables, \nand often topped with crispy fried pigskin. Chupe, cha\u2019que and lawa (aka \nlagua) are the most common thick, stew-like soups. Quinoa and man\u00ed are \noften used to thicken broth. \nMeat & Fish\nLlamas, alpacas and guinea pigs are the only animals domesticated in the Andes for meat production and are generally consumed during feasts and special occasions. Beef, chicken and fish are the backbone to nearly all Bolivian dishes; carne de chancho (pork) is considered a delicacy, \noften eaten deep-fried as chicharr\u00f3n, or roasted as lech\u00f3n. Campesinos  \n(subsistence farmers) eat more cordero  or carnero (mutton), cabrito or \nchivito (goat), or llama.\nBeef is typically asado or parrillada (barbecued or grilled) in various \ncuts ( lomo, brazuelo and churrasco). Jerked beef, llama or other red meat \nis called charque. A popular dish is pique a lo macho, a plate of chopped \ngrilled beef and sausage served with potatoes, onions, lettuce, tomatoes and locoto (chili peppers). On the Altiplano, beef is often served with \nchoclo (corn), corn on the cob, or mote (rehydrated dried corn kernels); in the lowlands it\u2019s served with yuca or mashed plantain. In the Beni, beef may be served as pacumutus,  enormous chunks of grilled meat \naccompanied by yuca, onions and other trimmings.\nPollo (chicken) is either frito (fried), al spiedo or a la broaster  (cooked \non a spit), or asado (barbecued) or dorado (broiled). Cheap chicken \nrestaurants are ubiquitous in Bolivia, where a meal of chicken and potatoes costs around B$7.\nOn the Altiplano the most deservedly popular pescado (fish) are trucha  \n(trout) and pejerrey (kingfish), introduced species from Lake Titicaca. \nThe lowlands have a wide variety of other freshwater fish; surub\u00ed, a catfish \ncaught throughout the lowlands, is arguably the best of the lot. Try to \nfind out which river your lowland fish might have come from, as some rivers may have been polluted with mercury cast-offs from mining. Fish from the Pilcomayo River, for example, is considered to be contaminated and unfit for consumption.\nTubers\nTuberous plants make up the bulk of the Bolivian diet and are native to the region; there are over 200 potato varieties. C hu\u00f1os or tunta (freeze-\ndried potatoes) are rehydrated, cooked and eaten as snacks or with meals. Although bland on their own, in soups such as chairo they can \nbe delicious.

In the lowlands, the potato and its relatives are replaced by plantain or the root of the yuca. \nCereals & Pulses\nOther common foods include choclo,  a large-kernel corn (maize) that\u2019s \nubiquitous on the Altiplano, and habas,  similar to the domesticated fava \nbeans that are eaten roasted or added to stews. In Cochabamba, ask for the delectable habas con quesillo  (beans with cheese).\nQuinoa, a unique Andean grain, is massively high in protein and is \nused to make flour and to thicken stews. Recent research has shown that it\u2019s the only edible plant that contains all essential amino acids in thesame proportions as milk, making it especially appealing to vegans. Packed with protein and fiber, it\u2019s considered a \u2018super food\u2019 and is deservedly experiencing a resurgence these days. Look for quinoa cookies, cakes, chocolate, croquettes, soups and bread. \nCa\u00f1awa  is another high-protein grain, typically roasted and ground \ninto a powder.\nFruit\nMany deliciously juicy South American fruits are cultivated in Bolivia. Most notable are the chirimoya  (custard apple) , tuna  (prickly pear cactus) \nand maracuya  and tumbo  passion fruits. \nIn the lowlands, the range of exotic tropical fruits defies middle-\nlatitude expectations. Among the more unusual are the human hand-shaped ambaiba;  the small, round, green-and-purple guaypur\u00fa;  the spiny \nyellow ocoro;  the lemon-like guapomo;  the bean-like cupesi;  the marayau,  \nwhich resembles a bunch of giant grapes; the currant-like nui; the scaly \nonion-looking sinini;  and the stomach-shaped paquio . \nDRINKS\nNonalcoholic Drinks\nMost common international drinks such as coffee, soda and bottled water \nare widely available. But don\u2019t leave the country without trying any of the local specialty drinks; many are gastronomic highlights. \nApi and mate de coca  are heated morning-time treats. Api is made from \na ground purple corn while mate de coca  is an infusion of water and dried \ncoca leaves. Another wonderful hot drink is trimate,  a combination of \nchamomile, coca and anise. A must try is a mocochinche,  a sugary peach \ndrink made from boiled cane sugar, cinnamon sticks and featuring a floating dried peach (another Andean food-preservation marvel). Also popular are the sweet and nutty tostada  and the corn-based horchata  and \nlicuados  (fruit shakes blended with water or milk). \nThroughout most towns and cities, juice vendors ply their trade from \ntheir fruit carts. For a mere B$3, you can enjoy an orange or grapefruit taste sensation.\nAlcoholic Drinks\nWhen Bolivians gather for recreational drinking \u2013 beer or something harder \u2013 they intend to get plastered. Remember that altitude increases both froth and effect. Bolivia produces its own wines, lagers and local concoctions of varying qualities.\nEnjoyable Bolivian regional lagers include the fizzy and strange-tasting \nHuari, the good but rather nondescript Pace\u00f1a (they have also introduced a delicious dark porter), the pleasant but weak-flavored Sure\u00f1a, the The white and pink \npasankalla  (corn puffs) \nthat you see in giant bags may be too chewy for some, but they use an age-old and sophisticatedfood preservation technique.\nThe humble soybean is one of Bolivia\u2019s most important exports but (sadly for vegetarians) is one of the most environ-mentally unfriendly crops to grow, causing havoc to the Bolivian landscape.\nBeer poured at high altitude generally has a frothier head. A local superstition is that the frothier your beer, the more money you have. The person with the frothiest lager head must take a pinch of the froth and put it in their pocket.\n08-food-drink-bol7.indd   44 08-food-drink-bol7.indd   44 8/12/09   09:33:08 8/12/09   09:33:08", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3816, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ca7968d-0aa7-4590-8bc5-2d7ad487a2ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ca7968d-0aa7-4590-8bc5-2d7ad487a2ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed548bc2-1c24-4e4e-866f-9efc41e6f0a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "ff7000722d9f94d1ca8e9360e6022b0662a8ad35dc589840be5cec88ccbc1d98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com FOOD & DRINK  \u2022\u2022  Celebrations   45\nrefreshing Taqui\u00f1a, the robust Potosina, the slightly rough Ducal and the \ncold and tasty Tropical Extra. \nWines are fermented around Tarija and are increasingly being recog-\nnized in the world of viticulture.

On the D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), families pre-pare the favorite dishes of their lo ved ones, along with little sweet breads, \nwith plaster-cast faces, representing their dead relatives. Very ornate and brightly iced cakes adorn cake shops and are a favorite for birthdays \u2013 the fancier the better. Confites  are sugar candies (surrounding coconut, \ndried peach or nuts) made by traditional candy makers; they\u2019re consumed during Carnaval time or for feasts such as Alasitas in La Paz (p76). There are several kinds of confites,  one of which is brightly colored and not \nconsumed, but instead is used as an offering at a cha\u2019lla  (blessing). \nWHERE TO EAT & DRINK\nLarger towns and cities have a range of eateries, from family-run opera-\ntions to upscale cloth-napkin restaurants. All towns have cheap food stalls in the market comedores (dining halls) that serve filling and tasty \nmeals and snacks. \nDisappointingly, there are a growing number of Western-style fast-\nfood joints in the big cities \u2013 to eat in these is sometimes seen as a status SPIRITS FOR THE SPIRITS\nThe Andean inhabitants believe their world is populated by well-respected supernatural beings, \nthe apus and achachilas  (mountain spirits said to be ancestors of the people). These beings, \nprone to both favorable behavior and fits of temper, are believed to pervade wild areas. The indigenous people see themselves as descendants of the much respected and venerated earth mother, Pachamama.\nThe spirits are taken into consideration in facets of everyday life, and certain things are done to \nkeep on their better side. Before a person takes the first sip of alcohol from a glass, it\u2019s customary to spill a few drops on the ground as an offering, or t\u2019inka,  to Pachamama. This demonstrates to \nPachamama that she takes precedence over her human subjects (and she likes to drink a drop, too). Alcohol is also splashed or sprinkled over homes and cars as a cha\u2019lla  (blessing).\nTarija\u2019s vines are grown \nat high altitude, which speeds up the maturing process of the grape. The wine producers are trying to establish whether the wine deteriorates faster due to these natural factors. \nMaca, a small turnip-type root vegetable, is considered the Viagra of the Andes.\n08-food-drink-bol7.indd   45 08-food-drink-bol7.indd   45 8/12/09   09:33:08 8/12/09   09:33:08", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c15a280-3819-4b13-b80f-84e1d29e371d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c15a280-3819-4b13-b80f-84e1d29e371d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2072d329-2624-4ab4-aa97-e6b3197f690c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "9c6f74a204ae6532dd15b79860b8f555791313acf2d0ee1b689777049d35a605", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com 46   FOOD & DRINK  \u2022\u2022  Vegetarians & Vegans\nsymbol. Restaurants serving typical European or North American foods \nare found around larger hotels or in middle-class districts of larger cities.Increasingly popular in larger cities are Italian restaurants, chifas  (Chinese\nrestaurants), and Mexican, Swiss and Japanese eateries. Peruvian cevicher\u00edas\n(specialized seafood restaurants) and vegetarian options are also on the rise. Best of all are the Bolivian/international restaurants, serving inter-national dishes with a Bolivian twist, using ingredients such as quinoa and the vast range of fresh ingredients that Bolivia should be so famous \nfor. Get your taste buds working, your juices flowing and absorb the wonderfully diverse tastes and flavors of Bolivia. \u00a1Buen provecho!\nQuick Eats \nMarkets and street stalls are the best places for cheap, on-the-go bites \nand local specialties.

You should be fine if you choose a stall that seems clean and well organized.\nConfiter\u00edas  and pasteler\u00edas  sell little more than snacks and coffee. \nHelader\u00edas  (ice-cream parlors) are becoming increasingly worldly, offer-\ning pizza, pasta, doughnuts, salte\u00f1as,  coffee specialties and even full (if \nbland) meals.\nVEGETARIANS & VEGANS\nVegetarians may well be delighted by what they find on offer. Many soups are prepared with vegetables and noodles, and often chu\u00f1o . More \nflexible vegetarians (who can put up with meat stock or pick meat out of a dish) will be fine. Vegans will find themselves eating a lot of potatoes in the highlands, and fresh fruits and vegetables elsewhere. Bigger cities and popular tourist areas have at least one vegetarian restaurant. The typical plato pace\u00f1o  (La Paz dish) is traditionally served without meat \u2013 \nit\u2019s just fried cheese, fresh corn and fava bean and, of course, potatoes. Check first, though, as many restaurants will include a piece of meat with the dish.\nHABITS & CUSTOMS\nNearly everything stops from noon to at least 3pm when families get to-gether and loll over a multi-hour lunch. It\u2019s the main meal of the day and no one rushes through it. Campesinos  may eat with their fingers among \nfamily, but Bolivians in general use Western-style utensils. Tipping up to 10% is standard at upscale restaurants when service is up to snuff; locals leave small change, if anything at all, elsewhere.\nEAT YOUR WORDS\nWant to know a pacumutu  from a pique a lo macho ?

While these cover large regions of the country, there\u2019s much more scope to the Bolivian landscape. \nThe country\u2019s varying altitude \u2013 between 130m in the jungles of the \nAmazon Basin and 6542m in the rugged Andes mountain range \u2013 means that a huge variety of ecological and geological spheres support a large number of plants and animals. Giant anteaters shelter here, as do ana-condas and armadillos, and the plants range from the much-lauded mahogany to palms. In 2005 a new species of monkey, the titi, was discovered in Madidi National Park (see p50).\nThe country\u2019s 1000 neotropical bird species and 5000 plants species \nrank among the highest numbers in the world; it\u2019s also among eight countries with the most diverse range of reptiles (16 of which exist only in Bolivia), and is home to 13 endemic mammals. \nThe 1990s saw a dramatic surge in international and domestic interest\nin ecological and environmental issues in the Amazon region. Since the creation of the government-run Servicio Nacional de \u00c1reas Protegidas \n(SERNAP;\nwww.sernap.gov.bo, in Spanish, see p63 for more information)  in 1997, 22 national pro-\ntected areas have been declared, covering 18% of the national terri-tory. This represents significant strongholds for rarer and regionally threatened wildlife such as spectacled bears, giant otters, Andean condors and jaguars. Local and international NGOs have worked with SERNAP to craft innovative ways to preserve select habitats.\nUnfortunately, however, much of the Bolivian environment is being \ndestroyed or is under threat and many regions risk exhaustion of their forest and wildlife resources; see p52.\nTHE LAND\nDespite the huge loss of territory in wars and concessions (see p24), at 1,098,581 sq km, landlocked Bolivia is South America\u2019s fifth-largest country, 3.5 times the size of the British Isles.\nTwo Andean mountain chains define the west of the country, with \nmany peaks above 6000m. The western Cordillera Occidental stands between Bolivia and the Pacific coast. The eastern Cordillera Real runs southeast, then turns south across central Bolivia, joining the other chain \nto form the southern Cordillera Central.\nThe haunting Altiplano, which ranges in altitude from 3500m to \n4000m, is boxed in by these two great cordilleras. It\u2019s an immense, nearly treeless plain punctuated by mountains and solitary volcanic peaks. At the Altiplano\u2019s northern end, straddling the Peruvian border, Lake Titicaca is one of the world\u2019s highest navigable lakes. In the far southwestern corner, the land is drier and less populated. The remnants of two vast ancient lakes, the Salar de Uyuni and the Salar de Coipasa, are there as well.\nEast of the Cordillera Central are the Central Highlands, a region \nof scrubby hills, valleys and fertile basins with a Mediterranean-like climate.\nNorth of the Cordillera Real, the  Yungas  form a transition zone be-\ntween arid highlands and humid lowlands. More than half of Bolivia\u2019s total area is in the Amazon  Basin, with sweaty tropical rainforest in the \nwestern section, and swamps, flat savannas and scrub in the east.Bolivia will never forget \n1879, the year it lost its outlet to the sea. Each year on March 23 it stages marches and events; discussion is still ongoing as to how it can regain access to the Pacific.\nThe bolivianita  is a rare \nsemiprecious stone made up of citrine and am-ethyst and has a pretty pinky-yellow color.\nThe Altiplano makes up only 10% of Bolivia\u2019s land mass, yet is the country\u2019s most densely populated zone.\n09-environment-bol7.indd   49 09-environment-bol7.indd   49 8/12/09   09:26:50 8/12/09   09:26:50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3752, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f115265-4642-447d-bc5e-795efe9da216": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f115265-4642-447d-bc5e-795efe9da216", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3070466-fb82-49c5-afb0-02806e99e4c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "c2be66572316eea158931bd76650b847709b6851f15de15f14c1dd9bb8525071", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com 50   ENVIRONMENT  \u2022\u2022  Wildlife\nIn the country\u2019s southeastern corner is the flat, nearly impenetrable \nscrubland of the Gran Chaco.\nWILDLIFE\nAnimals\nThanks to its varied geography, sparse human population and lack of extensive development, Bolivia is one of the best places on the continent to observe wildlife. Even the most seasoned wildlife observers will be impressed by Parque Nacional Madidi and Parque Nacional Noel Kempff Mercado.\nThe distribution of wildlife is largely dictated by the country\u2019s geogra-\nphy. The Altiplano is home to vicu\u00f1as, flamingos and condors. The elusive jaguars, tapirs and white-lipped and collared peccaries occupy the nearly inaccessible, harsh expanses of the Chaco in relatively healthy numbers. The Amazon Basin contains the richest density of species on earth, featur-ing an incredible variety of lizards, parrots, monkeys, snakes, butterflies, fish and bugs (by the zillions!). \nThe southern Altiplano is the exclusive habitat of the James flamingo. \nThe versatile rhea or \u00f1and\u00fa  (the South American ostrich) inhabits the \nregion from the Altiplano to the Beni, the Chaco and the Santa Cruz low-lands. In the highlands, lucky observers may see a condor; highly revered by the Inca, these rare vultures are the world\u2019s heaviest birds of prey.\nRiver travelers are almost certain to spot capybaras (large amphibious \nrodents), turtles, alligators, pink dolphins and, occasionally, giant river otters. It\u2019s not unusual to see anacondas in the rivers of the department of Beni, and overland travelers frequently see armadillos, rheas, sloths and jochis  (agoutis).\nYou won\u2019t have to travel very far to spot the most common Bolivian \nfauna \u2013 the llama and the alpaca \u2013 as these have been domesticated for centuries. \nENDANGERED & RARE SPECIES \nThe extremity of the landscape has kept many areas uninhabited by people for a long time, preserving pristine habitats for many exotic species.\nVicu\u00f1as, which fetch a bundle on the illicit market for their fuzzy \ncoats, are declining in the wild, but in a couple of Bolivian reserves their numbers have been increasing. Other precious wild highland species include foxes and tarukas  (Andean deer), the mysterious Andean cat \nand the titi monkey. \nIn Bolivia, guanacos are found exclusively in a remote part of the \nBolivian Chaco. The viscacha, a rabbit-like creature with a long tail, spends most of its time huddled under rocks in the highlands.\nThe tracks of pumas, native throughout the Americas, are occasionally \nseen in remote mountain ranges and in the Amazonian regions, but the The Andean condor, the \nworld\u2019s heaviest bird of prey, has a 3m wingspan and can effortlessly drag a 20kg carcass.\nAmateur birdwatchersshould get their binoculars out to catch a glimpse of South \nAmerican Birds: A Photographic Aid to Identification  by John \nStewart. Experts will want to spot Jon Fjeldsa\u2019s Birds of the High Andes .\nGOLDEN OPPORTUNITY\nWhen a team of researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, led by biologist Dr Robert \nWallace, discovered a new species of titi monkey in the park, they came up with a novel idea. As discoverers of the species, they had the rights to name it (it was spotted in 2000, but proceedings were formalized in 2005). Wallace and his team decided to auction the rights to the name, with all proceeds going to Fundesnap, a nonprofit foundation that protects the monkeys\u2019 habitat in Madidi National Park. The lucky winner? A Canadian online casino paid $650,000 for the rights to name the monkey callicebus avrei palatti (Golden Palace). \n09-environment-bol7.indd   50 09-environment-bol7.indd   50 8/12/09   09:26:50 8/12/09   09:26:50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "049f857f-7aa3-40ce-b996-b4a5440219b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "049f857f-7aa3-40ce-b996-b4a5440219b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90015baa-58ba-4264-b3de-524f26a63694", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "154dd38065ddb843ad203c1ed9905af3875e1032ba049abc265a3886ff395b03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com ENVIRONMENT  \u2022\u2022  Wildlife   51\nelusive character of this species means there\u2019s little chance of spotting \none without mounting a special expedition.\nRarer still, but present in national parks and remote regions, are jaguars, \nmaned wolves, giant anteaters and spectacled bears.

The Amazon Basin contains the richest botanical diversity on earth, with thousands of endemic species.\nNATIONAL PARKS & RESERVES\nBolivia has protected 18% of its total land by declaring 22 national protected areas and additional regional reserves under what is known as the Sistema Nacional de \u00c1reas Protegidas (SNAP), home to much of Bolivia\u2019s most amazing landscapes and wildlife. The administrative body SERNAP manages the 22 national protected areas. \nThe idea as of the last couple of years has been to encourage local \ninvolve ment and co-management of protected areas in an effort to attract tourists to community-based, ecotourism experiences, as well as to produce commercially viable natural products, including medicinal patents. Some of the success stories include the San Jos\u00e9 de Uchupia-monas community in Parque Nacional Madidi (p308) and the Tomarapi community in Parque Nacional Sajama (p163). A comprehensive guide to such initiatives in Bolivia was published in 2008: Deep Inside Bolivia  \n(Desde Adentro ). \nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES \nBolivian environmental problems are increasing rapidly and, while these \nhave not yet reached apocalyptic proportions, NGOs and environmental-ists are concerned that they are not being accompanied by the necessary measures to maintain a sound ecological balance. \nWhile Bolivia lacks the population pressures of Brazil, it is promoting \nindiscriminate colonization and development of its lowlands. In the past decades, settlers have continued to leave the highlands to clear lowland forest and build homesteads. Slash-and-burn agricultural techniques (see opposite), overgrazing and soil erosion all serve to create serious problems in many areas. There is also hydrocarbon exploration and il-legal logging in the area just outside the Parque Nacional Madidi, and the possible threat of a new road that will bisect the park.\nFurther east, particularly around the Santa Cruz and Beni depart-\nments, soybean crops continue to cause havoc. Huge tracts of land are cleared for soybean agriculture, but without crop-rotation programs the soil doesn\u2019t have enough time to recover. Similarly, cattle ranches are responsible for the destruction of vast areas of forest. Tracts of the Amazon are being exploited by both companies and individuals to fulfill international demand. \nMany water supplies used for irrigation and drinking are polluted, \nparticularly those around La Paz; much of this pollution ends up in the Amazon Basin. In fact, the Chipaya in the southern Altiplano are threat-ened by water pollution (p179). Glacial retreat on peaks due to global warming is an ongoing issue \u2013 in 2009, the 18,000 year-old Chacaltaya glacier, one of the highest in South America at 5421m, melted away entirely. Scientists predict that the handful of glaciers on the colossal Illimani that looms over La Paz will melt within 30 years. These glaciers are a major supply of water for La Paz, and their disappearance could cause some serious water shortage problems.The Andean sacred \nanimals include the condor, titi, puma, guinea pig, llama and frog.\nThe solstices are important dates for the people of the Andes. Winter (June 21), when the earth is prepared, dictates the agriculture; spring (September 21) is seed-sowing time; and summer (December 21) sees the start of the harvesting season.\n09-environment-bol7.indd   52 09-environment-bol7.indd   52 8/12/09   09:26:51 8/12/09   09:26:51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ca6a590-edf8-4817-ae62-a3a62e897eae": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ca6a590-edf8-4817-ae62-a3a62e897eae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "677da1da-74eb-4198-be16-8558d20082d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "71d4b10462ce5a1da32e66ce4dbdff75d4c624585490085ca87f1ce84595780f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com ENVIRONMENT  \u2022\u2022  Environmental Issues   53\nMany nonprofit groups are working on countrywide environmental \nconservation efforts.

Illimani is a blurry blob against the La Paz skyline, visitors to Lake Titicaca are deprived of spectacular views and there is the odd aviation problem.\nThis is all the result of el chaqueo , the slashing and burning of the savannas (and some rainforest)\nfor agricultural and grazing land \u2013 including cattle ranches and soybean crops. A prevailing notion is that the rising smoke forms rain clouds and ensures good rains for the coming season. In reality, the hydrological cycle, which depends on transpiration from the forest canopy, is inter-rupted by the deforestation, resulting in diminished rainfall. In extreme cases deforested zones may be sunbaked into wastelands. The latest World Bank records (from studies done between 2000 and 2005) estimate that each year Bolivia loses 0.45% of its forests in this manner, which is approximately 300,000 hectares per year.\nRanchers in the Beni department have long set fire to the savannas annually to encourage the \nsprouting of new grass. Now, however, the most dramatic defoliation occurs along the highways in the country\u2019s east. In the mid-1980s, this was largely virgin wilderness, accessible only by river or air, but the new roads connecting the region to La Paz have turned it into a free-for-all. Forest is consumed by expanding cattle ranches and only charred tree stumps remain. Although the burned vegetable matter initially provides rich nutrients for crops, those nutrients aren\u2019t replen-ished. After two or three years the land is exhausted and it takes 15 years to become productive again. That\u2019s too long for most farmers to wait; most just pull up stakes and burn larger areas.\nIronically, all this burning is prohibited by Bolivian forestry statutes \u2013 but such laws are \nimpossible to enforce in an area as vast as the Bolivian lowlands. When relatively few people were farming the lowlands, el chaqueo \u2019s effects were minimal, but given Bolivia\u2019s annual \npopulation growth rate of 1.38%, the country must feed a hefty number of additional mouths each year. Because much of this population growth is rural, more farmers\u2019 children are looking for their own lands.\nAlthough the long-term implications aren\u2019t yet known (hint: take a look at the devastated \nBrazilian states of Acre and Rond\u00f4nia), the Bolivian government has implemented a program aimed at teaching forest-fire control and encouraging lowland farmers to minimize el chaqueo  \nin favor of alternatives that don\u2019t drain the soil of nutrients. Despite these efforts, it seems that el chaqueo  will be a fact of life in Bolivia for many years to come.\n09-environment-bol7.indd   53 09-environment-bol7.indd   53 8/12/09   09:26:51 8/12/09   09:26:51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4237, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10108cab-1fe1-41eb-9dff-0d9a87c5b7c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "10108cab-1fe1-41eb-9dff-0d9a87c5b7c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38641cb0-7ae7-46e0-b79a-3fd350d77ecc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "27b9051bc4424734b254b4d3c73bdcbfbfb144bdfecfed61834c6a1d51e89824", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "54\nBolivia is all about getting breathless. If the beauty hasn\u2019t already taken your \nbreath away, then the high altitude might, at least when you first arrive. Then there is the outdoor fun; the country offers an awesome mix of activi-ties that get the lungs working and the heart pumping. Adventure compa-nies are entering the market faster than a downhill bike plunge, offering a great mix of trekking, climbing and mountain-biking activities. Adventurers can opt for hikes of all levels, from climbs up snowcapped mountains in the Cordillera Real, to low-key wanders along Inca trails or through the jungle. Do you want to retrace the steps of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid on horseback? Cruise in a 4WD across deserts? Shoot down a river in a raft or tube? No problem: it\u2019s all here, plus more; basic skiing, wildlife-watching and even ziplining (see boxed text, p306) are yours for the doing.\nHIKING & TREKKING\nHiking and trekking are arguably the most rewarding Andean activities. Bolivia rivals Nepal in trekking potential, but has only relatively recently been discovered by enthusiasts. Some of the most popular hikes and treks in Bolivia begin near La Paz, traverse the Cordillera Real along ancient Inca routes and end in the Yungas. These include the well-known and well-used Choro (p124), Takesi (p127) and Yunga Cruz (p129) treks. Sorata is a trekker\u2019s dream-come-true, with a variety of trails, from don\u2019t-leave-home-without-a-machete\u2013type hikes \u2013 the Mapiri Trail (p138) among them \u2013 to more pleasant walks on Inca trails. The \u00c1rea Natural de Manejo Integrado Nacional (Anmin) Apolobamba (p146) is becom-ing more popular for medium-standard trekking, including the four- to five-day Lagunillas to Agua Blanca trek (p147), thanks to improved access from La Paz and a growing number of accommodations options. \nNational parks are hikers\u2019 paradises, with opportunities in Parque \nNacional & \u00c1rea de Uso M\u00faltiple Ambor\u00f3 (p276) and, for anyone who makes it there, in Parque Nacional Noel Kempff Mercado (p318). Bird-watching and endemic plants are just part of the magic.\nLess hardcore trekkers can enjoy the cultural and historical sites and \nhot springs around Cordillera de los Frailes (p223).\nMuggings and robberies continue to be reported in some regions, so be \nsure to inquire locally about the safety of trails before heading out. \nMOUNTAINEERING & CLIMBING\nClimbing in Bolivia is an exercise in extremes \u2013 like the country itself. In the dry southern winter (May to October) temperatures may fluctu-ate as much as 40.5\u00b0C in a single day. Once you\u2019re acclimatized to the Altiplano\u2019s relatively thin air (you\u2019ll need at least a week), there is still 2500m of even thinner air lurking above. \nA plus for climbers is the access to mountains; although public trans-\nportation may not always be available, roads pass within easy striking distance of many fine peaks.\nThe most accessible and spectacular climbing in the country is along \nthe 160km-long Cordillera Real northeast of La Paz. Six of its peaks rise above 6000m and there are many more gems in the 5000m range. Because of the altitude, glaciers and ice or steep snow, few of the peaks are \u2018walk-ups,\u2019 but some are within the capability of the average climber, and many can be done by beginners with a competent guide.

La Paz operators also take climbs up the magnificent Volc\u00e1n Sajama (p163), Bolivia\u2019s highest peak. \nAround Cordillera Quimsa Cruz (p150) there are a variety of lesser- \nknown climbing opportunities. Volc\u00e1n Illimani (p142) is for serious climbing expeditions and popular among advanced climbing groups.\nThe dangers of Bolivian climbing are due to ill-equipped or poorly \ntrained guides, the altitude and the difficulties in mounting any sort of rescue. Mountaineering insurance is essential to cover the high costs of rescue and to ensure medical evacuation out of the country in the event of a serious accident. Note that helicopters cannot fly above 5000m. There is a small but potentially serious avalanche danger. For information on dealing with potentially fatal altitude problems, it\u2019s wise to carry the practical and easily transportable Mountain Sickness , by Peter Hackett, \nwhenever you ascend to high altitude. See p358 for information about altitude sickness.\nThe Asociaci\u00f3n de Guias de Monta\u00f1a  \n(% 2-214-7951; www.agmtb.org, in Spanish; Edificio\nDoryan, Sag\u00e1rnaga 189, La Paz)  is an internationally certified association of \nregistered mountain guides; they also have a group of professional high-altitude rescuers. \nMAPS\nHistorically, maps of Bolivian climbing areas have been poor in quality and difficult to obtain. Even now, elevations of peaks are murky, with reported altitudes varying as much as 600m \u2013 it seems the rumor that Ancohuma is taller than Aconcagua won\u2019t die. A useful website \nfor climbers\u2019 logs and accounts on climbs in the Andes is www.andeshandbook.cl.RESPONSIBLE TREKKING\nTo help preserve the ecology and beauty of Bolivia, consider the following tips when trekking.\n\u0084 Carry out all your rubbish. Okay, so many tracks in Bolivia are already littered, but this doesn\u2019t \nmean that you should contribute to it. Don\u2019t overlook easily forgotten items, such as silver paper, orange peel, cigarette butts and plastic wrappers. \n\u0084 Never bury your rubbish: digging disturbs soil and ground cover and encourages erosion. \nBuried rubbish will likely be dug up by animals, who may be injured or poisoned by it. It may also take years to decompose.\n\u0084 Contamination of water sources by human feces can lead to the transmission of all sorts of \nnasties. Where there is a toilet, please use it. Where there is none, bury your waste. Dig a small hole 15cm (6 inches) deep and at least 100m (320ft) from any watercourse. Cover the waste with soil and a rock. In snow, dig down to the soil.\n\u0084 Don\u2019t use detergents or toothpaste in or near watercourses, even if they are biodegradable.\n\u0084 Hillsides and mountain slopes, especially at high altitudes, are prone to erosion. Stick to \nexisting trails and avoid short cuts.\n\u0084 Don\u2019t depend on open fires for cooking. The cutting of wood for fires in popular trekking \nareas can cause rapid deforestation.

The Andes of Bolivia, \nby Alain Mesili, was recently translated into English. \nAGENCIES & GUIDES\nMany travel agencies in La Paz and larger cities organize climbing and trekking trips in the Cordillera Real and other areas (see p350 for a list of recommended tour companies). Not all, however, are everything they claim to be. Some guides have gotten lost, several have died, and others have practiced less-than-professional tactics, such as stringing 10 or more climbers on the same rope. Always do your research and go with professionally accredited guides such as those registered with Asociaci\u00f3n de Guias de Monta\u00f1a (p59); you\u2019ll find them to be more expensive than independent guides, but it\u2019s worth the cost.\nSpecialist agencies can do as much or as little as you want \u2013 from \njust organizing transportation to a full service with guide, cook, mules, porters, a full itinerary and so forth. Professional trekking guides generally charge US$40 to US$60 per day (plus their food) for chal-lenging treks such as volcano climbs. Note that you may be able to find something cheaper in the agencies along Sag\u00e1rnaga but these \u2018guides\u2019 are often in reality porters and cooks. In addition you need your food, technical equipment and clothing, and \u2013 often the most expensive part of any trip \u2013 transportation to and from the base camp or the start of the trek. Some people do resort to public transportation or hitchhiking on camiones  (flatbed trucks), but this requires more time, patience \nand logistics. \nIn addition to the agencies \u2013 one of the best is the high-quality Bolivian \nMountains (\n% 2-249-2775;

One of the world\u2019s longest downhill rides will take you from Parque Nacional Sajama (p163) down to the Chilean coast at Arica. In the dry se ason you can even tackle the mostly \nlevel roads of the vast Amazon lowlands. Parque Nacional Noel Kempff Mercado (p318) also offers the chance to explore on a treadly.\nSome rides from La Paz can be done by riders of any experience level. \nThere are more combinations than a bike lock: trails follow Inca roads, tropical tracks, jeep roads and scree chutes. The best known (but not necessarily the best ride for serious riders as there\u2019s lots of traffic and dust) is the thrilling 3600m trip down the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Road (see boxed text, p74) from La Cumbre to Coroico. Another popular route near La Paz is the lush Zongo Valley ride (p121), which can be started at the 5395m Chacaltaya. \nThe town of Sorata is emerging as the mountain-bike mecca of Bolivia, \nwith scores of downhill single-track trails and jeep road rides near town, including a combination bike-and-boat trip from Sorata to Rurrenabaque (see boxed text, below). For the hardcore rider, scree chutes to biker-built single track and jump zones abound. Every year, typically in October, Sorata is host to the longest downhill race on a hand-built course, the Jach\u2019a Avalancha (Grand Avalanche) Mountain Bike race. Other epic descents begin in Sorata and head into the hinterland of the Cordillera Mu\u00f1ecas, or start in Copacabana and La Paz and head to Sorata. For descriptions of these routes, see boxed text, p121.Each year the Jach\u2019a \nAvalancha (Grand Avalanche) Mountain Bike race is held in Sorata, attracting local and international participants to its two hand-built downhill tracks.

Those with their own bikes need to consider several factors. During partof the rainy season, particularly December to February, some roads become mired in muck, and heavy rain can greatly reduce visibility, creating dangerous conditions. Also worth noting is Bolivia\u2019s lack of spare parts and shortage of experienced mechanics. Comprehensive repair kits are essential. In the Southern Altiplano and Uyuni regions, water is very scarce; you must be able to carry at least two days\u2019 worth of water in some places.\n4WD\nHeading out in 4WD vehicles is becoming an increasingly popular activ-ity. It allows you access to places that are tricky to get to and, although sometimes on the pricier side, may be the only feasible way of visiting a region. As well as the standard Southwest Circuit tours (setting off from Uyuni, Tupiza or La Paz), you can cruise out to the quebradas  (ravines \nor washes, usually dry) and beyond Tupiza (p185), visit the Tarabuco \nmarket (p222; by tour from Sucre, see p218) or the Inca ruins near Cochabamba (p202).\nTours in 4WDs are a great way to enter some of the country\u2019s national \nparks. Current trips include those around Parque Nacional Torotoro (from Cochabamba; p210) and Parque Nacional Sajama (from La Paz; see p350) or into the Cordillera de los Frailes (from Sucre; p217).\nFor those keener to arrange trips themselves, consider hiring a driver. \nThis can be an efficient and good-value way of seeing specific areas, especially if you are in a group. See p348 for a list of drivers.\nWHITEWATER RAFTING & KAYAKING\nOne of Bolivia\u2019s greatest secrets is the number of whitewater rivers that drain the eastern slopes of th e Andes between the Cordillera Apolobamba \nand the Chapare. Here, avid rafters and kayakers can enjoy thrilling descents. While access will normally require long drives and/or treks \u2013 and considerable expense if done independently \u2013 there are a few fine rivers that are relatively accessible. \nSome La Paz tour agencies can organize day trips on the R\u00edo Coroico \n(p121). Other options include the R\u00edo Unduavi (p132) and numerous wild Chapare rivers (p297). Wilderness canoeing is offered in Parque Nacional Isiboro-S\u00e9cure (p298).\nA more gentle but fun rush in the Chuquisaca region is a float down-\nriver in rubber inner-tubes. This trip is often coupled with mountain biking (p218). One of the greatest thrills along the same biathlon idea, is to cruise 4000m downhill on mountain bike to Mapiri and then raft your way for several days, camping en route, to Rurrenabaque (see boxed text, p57). Check the Andean Epics Ride Company in Sorata (p135) for a variety of whitewater rafting trips.\nHORSEBACK RIDING\nFor some, a horse saddle sure beats a bus seat. It\u2019s a great way to absorb the sights, sounds and smells of a country. Horseback-riding trips are a new and increasingly popular way to see inaccessible wilderness areas. The best place to get your butt into a saddle is in Tupiza, former territory of \u2018Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\u2019 (p182).

Most travelers enter this extraordinary city via the flat, sparse plains of the sprawling city of El Alto, an approach that hides the sensational surprises of the valley below. The first glimpse of La Paz will, literally, take your breath away. The city\u2019s buildings cling to the sides of the canyon and spill spectacularly downwards. On a clear day, the imposing showy, snowy Mt Illimani (6402m) looms in the background. \nAlthough Sucre still hangs on to its status as the constitutional capital, La Paz \u2013 Bolivia\u2019s \nlargest city and centre for commerce, finance and industry \u2013 is the country\u2019s seat of govern-ment. Meanwhile, El Alto is the Aymar\u00e1 capital of the world.

Wander at leisure through the alleys and lively markets, marvel at the interesting museums, chat to the locals in a \ncomedor  (dining hall) or relax over a \ncoffee at a trendy cafe.\nSince La Paz is sky-high, warm clothing is desirable most of the year, at least in the eve-\nnings. In summer (November to April) the climate can be harsh: rain falls most afternoons, the canyon may fill with clouds and steep streets often become torrents of runoff. In winter (May to October) days can be slightly cooler, but the sun (and its UV rays) is strong and temperatures reach the high 60s; at night it often dips below freezing.\n \u0084  TELEPHONE CODE: 2        \u0084  POPULATION: 829,000                    \u0084  ELEVATION: 3660MLa PazLA PAZ\n11-la-paz-bol7.indd   6011-la-paz-bol7.indd   60 8/12/09   09:33:378/12/09   09:33:37\u00a9 Lonely Planet", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2423, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83c412ba-b2cb-43fa-b860-4b7f08a55339": {"__data__": {"id_": "83c412ba-b2cb-43fa-b860-4b7f08a55339", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42db9b61-0b03-451c-864a-55d8bed5d5ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "946b47212e0bedf0da57d12b8192001384f260f0be07f36a9713a979597df320", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2d7d868-7d3c-4f96-8eeb-c7cfa649dc20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f870546ab804a66632a2cfda23febf6562980c053e5b260ca2d77c2786315c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comLA PAZLA P AZ  \u2022\u2022  History   61\nQuemado (Burned Palace), owing to its \nrepeated gutting by fire.

There is only one major thorough-fare and it follows the R\u00edo Choqueyapu canyon (fortunately for your olfactory system, the river flows mostly under-ground). The main thoroughfare changes names several times from the top to the bottom: Avs Ismael Montes, Mariscal Santa Cruz, 16 de Julio (the Prado) and Villaz\u00f3n. Quite often the section is simply referred to as \u2018El Prado.\u2019 At the lower end of the thoroughfare, the street divides into Avs 6 de Agosto and Aniceto Arce.\nThe business districts and the wealthier \nneighborhoods \u2013 with their skyscrapers, colonial houses and modern glass construc-tions \u2013 occupy the city\u2019s more tranquil lower altitudes (which is the reverse of many US and European cities). The best preserved colonial section of town is near the inter-section of Calles Ja\u00e9n and Sucre, where narrow cobbled streets and colonial churches offer a glimpse of early La Paz. The most prestigious neighborhoods are found further down in the canyon in Zona Sur (Southern Zone, which includes the neighborhoods of Obrajes, La Florida, Calacoto, San Miguel and Cotacota, as well as a growing throng of other barrios. Numbered streets run perpendicular to the main road in Zona Sur, making navigation easier; the numbers increase from west to east. \nAbove the city center and Zona Sur, and \nstill very much part of La Paz, are the cas-cades of cuboid, mud and brick dwellings and ever-growing neighborhoods, which literally spill over the canyon rim and down the slopes on three sides. This is where much of the daily hustle and bustle takes place, with all sorts of sights, sounds and smells. Above this, stretching for miles away from the canyon\u2019s rim across the Altiplano, is the city of El Alto. If you find yourself becom-ing disoriented up here and want to return to the center, just head downhill. HISTORY\nLa Ciudad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (the City of Our Lady of Peace) was founded and named on October 20, 1548, by a Spaniard, Captain Alonzo de Mendoza, at present-day Laja situated on the Tiwanaku road. Soon after, La Paz was shifted to its present location, the valley of the Chuquiago Marka (now called the R\u00edo Choqueyapu), which had been occupied by a community of Aymar\u00e1 miners.\nThe 16th-century Spanish historian Cieza \nde Le\u00f3n remarked of the newfound city: \u2018This is a good place to pass one\u2019s life. Here the climate is mild and the view of the mountains inspires one to think of God.\u2019 But despite Le\u00f3n\u2019s lofty assessment (perhaps he mis-takenly got off at Cochabamba), the reason behind the city\u2019s founding was much more terrestrial. The Spanish always had a weak-ness for shiny yellow metal, and the now-fetid R\u00edo Choqueyapu, which today flows underneath La Paz, seemed to be full of it. \nThe Spaniards didn\u2019t waste any amount of \ntime in seizing the gold mines, and Captain Mendoza was installed as the new city\u2019s first mayor. The conquerors also imposed their religion and their lifestyle on the indigenous people, and since most of the colonists were men, unions between Spanish men and indi genous women eventually gave rise to a primarily mestizo population.\nIf the founding of La Paz had been based \non anything other than gold, its position in the depths of a rugged canyon probably would have dictated an unpromising future. However, the protection this setting pro-vided from the fierce Altiplano climate and the city\u2019s convenient location on the main trade route between Lima and Potos\u00ed \u2013 much of the Potos\u00ed silver bound for Pacific ports passed through La Paz \u2013 offered the city some hope of prosperity once the gold had played out.

At night, ask the restaurant or hotel to call a cab \u2013 the cab\u2019s details are recorded at a central base.

Bolivia\u2019s govern mental capital has its share of cultural and histori-cal museums, most of which are found in the city center or close surrounds. Y et much of the enjoyment comes from observing the rhythms of local life. Much of the daily action takes place in the upper central regions of La Paz, where a mass of irregular shaped steep streets and alleys wind their way skywards. Here, locals embrace their frenetic daily life. Women, sporting long black plaits, bowler hats and vivid mantas , \nattend to steaming pots or sell everything from dried llama fetuses to designer shoes, while men, negotiating the frenetic traffic (and its fumes), push overladen trolleys. Keep your eyes peeled for fantastic glimpses of Illimani\u2019s triple peak towering between the world\u2019s highest high-rises. Many visi-tors allow another day or two to acclimatize during a day trip to Tiwanaku (p93) or Lake Titicaca (p97). \nMost official sites, including museums, \nare closed over the Christmas holiday period (December 25 to January 6).\nCathedral & Plaza Murillo\nAlthough it\u2019s a relatively recent addition to La Paz\u2019s collection of religious struc-tures, the 1835 cathedral  (Map pp68-9) is \nan impressive structure \u2013 mostly because it is built on a steep hillside. The main La Paz is a great city to explore on foot, \nbut take the local advice \u2018camina lentito, \ncome poquito\u2026y duerme solito\u2019  (walk slowly, \neat only a little bit\u2026and sleep by your poor little self) to avoid feeling the effects of soroche  (altitude sickness). \nIn the last couple of years, it seems traffic\nhas increased tenfold due in part to second-hand car imports \u2013 take care in crossing roadsand avoid walking in busy streets at peak hours when fumes can be overwhelming.\nScams\nSadly, La Paz seems to have caught on to South America\u2019s common ruses. The bogus tourist is a popular one: on engaging you in conversation in English, the \u2018tourist\u2019 is confronted by fake \u2018tourist police.\u2019 The \u2018tourist\u2019 abides by an \u2018order\u2019 to show the tourist police his bag/papers/passport, and \u2018translates\u2019 for you to do the same. During the search, the cohorts strip you of your cash and/or belongings. \nPsst my friend! This popular scam \ninvolves someone spilling a substance on you or spitting a phlegm ball at you. While you or they are wiping it off, another lifts your wallet or slashes your pack; the perpetrator may be an \u2018innocent\u2019 granny or young girl. Similarly, make sure that you don\u2019t bend over to pick up a valuable item which has been \u2018dropped.\u2019 You risk being accused of theft, or of being pickpocketed. See also p330.\nWARNING: SAN PEDRO PRISON\nIt\u2019s likely you won\u2019t be in La Paz long before you\u2019ll hear about \u2018tours\u2019 to San Pedro prison \u2013 from \nother travelers, or sometimes operators and hostels. We strongly advise against participating in one of these unofficial \u2013 and, in fact, illegal \u2013 \u2018tours\u2019, which are organized by inmates, guards and dodgy operators. There are high risks associated with entering San Pedro prison. First, it\u2019s illegal, and the Bolivian authorities are cracking down on unofficial visits. In 2009 the government restricted visiting hours to try to stop prison tourism; this had a negative impact on many people, including the wives and children of inmates. In response, prisoners rioted. \nInside the prison, there\u2019s no protection or guarantee of your safety. If you\u2019re robbed, \nassaulted or worse, you are unlikely to be defended and will have no possible recourse. While most visitors to the prison go for curiosity\u2019s sake \u2013 which can border on voyeurism \u2013 others undoubt-edly visit to purchase cocaine. The danger of doing so cannot be overstated. Despite its ubiquity, cocaine is illegal, and if you\u2019re caught with it, you could end up staying at San Pedro prison for much longer than an afternoon; Bolivian drug penalties are severe.

(One fatal accident occurred during our research period.) Other accidents are due to little or no instruction and preparation, and poor-quality mountain bikes; beware bogus rebranded bikes and recovered brake pads. \nUnfortunately, even though it is such an adventurous activity, there are no minimum safety \nstandards in place for operators of this trip, and no controls over false advertising, or conse-quences for unsafe operating practices. In short, many agencies are less than ideal. As such the buyer has to be aware, even a bit paranoid; this is one activity where you don\u2019t want to be attracted by cheaper deals. Experienced and trained guides, high-quality bikes, well-developed risk-management systems, and adequate rescue equipment all cost money, and cheaper com-panies may stretch the truth about what they provide if it means making another sale. Cost cutting can mean dodgy brakes, poor-quality parts and literally, a deadly treadly. This, plus inexperienced and untrained guides and little or no rescue and first-aid equipment, is a truly scary combination on the WMDR. \n11-la-paz-bol7.indd   75 11-la-paz-bol7.indd   75 8/12/09   09:33:42 8/12/09   09:33:42", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2656, "end_char_idx": 4860, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a9863e7-f32e-458c-8f73-002027917962": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a9863e7-f32e-458c-8f73-002027917962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c560262-da17-4971-95c6-4511f3645143", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "76cab54ed4e4d3c8498836e0627060a79858d681a9b04789d6dd3f0e57a42a3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comLA PAZ76   LA P AZ  \u2022\u2022  Festivals & Events\nof the original. \u2018Abundance\u2019 was redefined to apply not \nonly to crops, but also to homes, tools, cash, clothing, cars, trucks, airplanes and even 12-story buildings.

The following year the local union of embroiderers formed a folkloric group to participate in the event. In subsequent years other festival-inspired folkloric groups joined in, and the celebration grew larger and more lively. It has now developed into a unique La Paz festival, with dancers and folkloric groups from around the city participating. Embroiderers prepare elaborate costumes for the event and upwards of 25,000 performers practice for weeks in advance. El Gran Poder is a wild and exciting time, and offers a glimpse of Aymar\u00e1 culture at its festive finest. A number of dances are featured, such as the suri sikuris  \n(in which the dancers are bedecked in ostrich feathers), the lively kullasada,  morenada,  caporales  and the inkas,  \nwhich duplicates Inca ceremonial dances.\nAyamar\u00e1 New Year & San Juan  The winter solstice is \ncelebrated across the Altiplano around June 21, the longest and coldest night of the year.

If you insist on public transpor-tation, crowded micros marked \u2018Prado\u2019 and \n\u2018Av Arce\u2019 pass the main tourist areas.

The trip takesnine to 10 hours, including lunch in Copa ca-bana and the border-crossing formalities.If a company doesn\u2019t fill its bus, passengersmay be shunted to another company so no one runs half-empty buses.

Especially considering the altitude, strug-gling up the hills through traffic with bulky luggage isn\u2019t recommended.\nRadio taxis (with roof bubbles advertising\ntheir telephone numbers) are recommended as the safer option. They charge about B$4 around the center, B$8 to B$10 (more in peak hours) from Sag\u00e1rnaga to Sopocachi or Sopocachi to the cemetery district and B$15 to B$20 to Zona Sur. Charges are a little higher after 11pm. \nMost regular taxis are also collective taxis \nand charge a per-person rate. This means that the driver may pick up additional passengers, and that you can flag down a taxi already carrying passengers. Regular taxis charge B$6 per person around the center (a bit more for long uphill routes).\nIf possible, ask your hotel or restaurant \nto ring for a taxi (see Dangers & Annoy-ances, p66). Otherwise, taxis can be waved down anywhere, except near intersections or in areas cordoned off by the police. If you\u2019re traveling beyond the city center, or your journey involves a long uphill climb, confirm the fare with the driver before climbing in (it will usually be slightly more than the regular fare), and try to carry small change at all times.\nPre-ordered or radio taxis to the airport \ncost from around B$50 to B$70.\nAROUND LA P AZ\nVALLE DE LA LUNA\nAbout 10km down the canyon of the R\u00edo Choqueyapu from the city center, Valle de la \nLuna  \n(Valley of the Moon; admission B$15)  is a slightly \noverhyped place, though it\u2019s a pleasant break from urban La Paz. It could be easilyvisited in a morning or combined with another outing such as a hike to Muela del Diablo (p91) to fill an entire day. It isn\u2019t a valley at all, but a bizarre, eroded hillside maze of canyons and pinnacles technicallyknown as badlands. Several species of cactus 2 along Av Y anacocha. Heading into the city \nfrom the cemetery by day you can catch micros along Av Baptista.

In fine weather, you\u2019ll have good views of Illimani along this section. For this route you\u2019ll need a compass and the 1:50,000 topo sheets 5944-I and 6044-III.\nTo return to La Paz, follow the road \nfor 2km up over Paso Huni and then for another 1.5km downhill to Apa\u00f1a, where you\u2019ll catch up with regular micros  and \ntrufis returning to the city.\nCA\u00d1\u00d3N DE PALCA \nThe magnificent Palca Canyon (marked on topo sheets as Quebrada Chua Kheri) brings a slice of Grand Canyon country to the dramatic badland peaks and eroded amphitheaters east of La Paz. A walk through this gorge makes an ideal day hike from La Paz. Note: go only in groups as assaults on single hikers at the time of research have been reported here. Check the safety status before setting out.\nA good, safe alternative is to head out \nwith La Paz on Foot (p75), which offers ex-\ncellent guided day hikes through the canyon (US$45 per person including transportation and lunch).\nSleeping & Eating\nPalca is a pleasant, basic town located rela-tively close to the exit of the canyon. It has a simple hostal \n(r per person B$20-40) , which offers\nset meals and is popular with Bolivian tourists on weekends. Alternatively, you can camp around Palca or nearby Ventilla. Beware of the badly polluted surface water, and ask permission before you set your tent up in a field or pasture. \nHuni is a small town above the entrance \nto Ca\u00f1\u00f3n de Palca. It has a store selling basic supplies, including bottled water and snack foods, and also provides Bolivian set-menu meals at lunchtime.\nGetting There & Away\nFor the start of this hike, you need to reach Huni, which is served only by micros and \ntrufis headed for Ventilla and Palca. These leave at least once daily from near the corner of Boquer\u00f3n and Lara, two blocks climbing the other side of the valley to the zoo in Mallasa. The latter option will turn this hike into a full-day trip, as it takes about six hours for the hike between Pedregal and Mallasa.\nGetting There & Away\nFrom La Paz the best access to the start of the hike is on minibus 288, marked \u2018Pedregal,\u2019 from the lower Prado. The end of the line is the parking area a couple of hundred meters downhill from Pedregal\u2019s cemetery. Returning from Valle de la Luna, you can board these minibuses at Zona Sur\u2019s Plaza Humboldt or follow the difficult walking track from near the zoo in Mallasa, which involves a descent to the R\u00edo Choqueyapu and then a stiff 600m ascent to the eastern side of the muela. To return to La Paz from \nPedregal, catch a \u2018Prado\u2019 minibus from the parking area.\nVALLE DE LAS \u00c1NIMAS\nThe name Valley of Spirits is used to describe the eerily eroded canyons and fantastic organ-pipe spires to the north and northeast of the barrios of Chasquipampa, Ovejuyo and Apa\u00f1a (which are rapidly being absorbedinto the Zona Sur neighborhoods of La Paz). The scenery resembles that of Valle de la Luna, but on a grander scale. It\u2019s worth just getting out here.\nThere are two (long-day) walking routes \nthrough the valley: the R\u00edo Ovejuyo Route and the Quebrada Negra Route. The R\u00edo Ovejuyo walk requires a compass and 1:50,000 topography sheet 5944-II and, \nfor a very short section, topo sheet 5944-I \n(see p63 for details on where to get maps).

Archaeologists generally agree that the civilization which spawned Tiwanaku rose around 600 BC. Construction on the ceremonial site was under way by about AD 700, but around 1200 the group had melted into obscurity, becoming another \u2018lost\u2019 civilization. Evidence of its influence, particularly its religion, has been found throughout the vast area that later became the Inca empire.\nThe treasures of Tiwanaku have literally \nbeen scattered to the four corners of the earth. Its gold was looted by the Spanish, and early stone and pottery finds were sometimes destroyed by religious zealots who consid-ered them pagan idols. Some of the work found its way to European museums; farm-ers destroyed pieces of it as they turned the surrounding area into pasture and cropland; the Church kept some of the statues or sold them as curios; and the larger stonework north of Plaza L\u00edbano in the San Pedro district of La Paz.

Significant finds from this period include multicolored pottery and human or animal effigies in painted clay. Tiwanaku II, which ended around the beginning of the Christian era, is hallmarked by ceramic vessels with horizontal handles. Tiwanaku III dominatedthe next 300 years, and was characterized by tricolor pottery of geometric design, often decorated with images of stylized animals.\nTiwanaku IV, also known as the Classic \nPeriod, developed between AD 300 and 700. The large stone structures that dominatethe site today were constructed during this period. The use of bronze and gold is con-sidered evidence of contact with groups further east in the Cochabamba valley and further west on the Peruvian coast. TiwanakuIV pottery is largely anthropomorphic. Pieces uncovered by archaeologists includesome in the shape of human heads and faces with bulging cheeks, indicating that the coca leaf was already in use at this time.\nTiwanaku V, also called the Expansive \nPeriod, is marked by a decline that lasted until Tiwanaku\u2019s population completely disappeared around 1200. Pottery grew less elaborate, construction projects slowed and stopped, and no large-scale monuments were added after the early phases of this period.\nWhen the Spaniards arrived in South \nAmerica, local indigenous legends recountedthat Tiwanaku had been the capital of the bearded, white god-king called Viracocha, and that from his city Viracocha had reigned over the civilization.\nVisiting the Ruins\nScattered around the Tiwanaku site, you\u2019ll find heaps of jumbled basalt and sandstone slabs weighing as much as 25 tons each. Oddly enough, the nearest quarries that could have produced the basalt megaliths are on the Copacabana peninsula, 40km away beyond the lake. Even the sandstone blocks had to be transported from a site more than 5km away. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that when the Spanish asked local Aymar\u00e1 how the buildings were constructed, they replied that it was done with the aid of the leader/deity Viracocha. They could conceiveof no other plausible explanation.went into Spanish construction projects, and even into the bed of the La Paz\u2013Guaqui rail line that passes just south of the site.\nFortunately, a portion of the treasure \nhas been preserved, and some of it remains in Bolivia. A few of the larger anthropo-morphic stone statues have been left on the site. Others are on display at the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda (p70) in La Paz. New finds from the earliest Tiwanaku periods are being added to the collection of the new onsite Museo Litico \nMonumental  \n(admission US$10; h 9am-5pm) . The \nstar of the show is the massive Monolito \nBennetto Pachamama , rescued in 2002 \nfrom its former smoggy home at the out-door Templete Semisubterr\u00e1neo (p73) in La Paz. \nPieces from the three more recent Tiwanaku\nperiods may be found scattered around Bolivia, but the majority are housed in archaeological museums in La Paz and Cochabamba. The ruins themselves have been so badly looted, however, that much of the information they could have revealed about their builders is now lost forever.\nLabeling at the onsite museums is sparse \nand almost exclusively in Spanish.

While only a very small percentage of the original site has been excavated \u2013 and what remains is less than overwhelming \u2013 Tiwanaku repre-sents the greatest megalithic architectural achievement of pre-Inca South America.\nThe development of the Tiwanaku civili-\nzation has been divided by researchers into five distinct periods, numbered Tiwanaku I through V, each of which has its own outstanding attributes.\n11-la-paz-bol7.indd   94 11-la-paz-bol7.indd   94 8/12/09   09:33:45 8/12/09   09:33:45", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3253, "end_char_idx": 4391, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdd3065c-c8a0-40fd-9c2c-b5dd7138cb5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdd3065c-c8a0-40fd-9c2c-b5dd7138cb5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cfcdad2a-d103-44a7-8d08-d4a148a2d3dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "73c6e30ce6e3def0899c34ca29ac00c03b99755905d6e30a09fc2c7f1a679020", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comLA PAZAROUND LA P AZ  \u2022\u2022  Tiwanaku   95\nwhich is an interior courtyard and the ruins \nof priests\u2019 quarters. Note the size of the top stair \u2013 a massive single block.\nOther stairways lead to secondary plat-\nforms, where there are other monoliths including the famous El Fraile  (priest). At \nthe far northwest corner of Kalasasaya is Tiwanaku\u2019s best-known structure, the Puerta \ndel Sol  (Gateway of the Sun). This megalithic \ngateway was carved from a single block of andesite, and archaeologists assume that it was associated in some way with the sun deity. The surface of this fine-grained, gray volcanic rock is ornamented with low-relief designs on one side and a row of four deep niches on the other. Some believe these may have been used for offerings to the sun, while others maintain that the stone served as some kind of calendar. The structure is estimated to weigh at least 44 tons.\nThere\u2019s a smaller, similar gateway carved \nwith zoomorphic designs near the western end of the site that is informally known as the Puerta de la Luna  (Gateway of the Moon).\nEast of the main entrance to Kalasasaya, \na stairway leads down into the Templete Tiwanaku\u2019s most outstanding structure \nis the Akapana pyramid , which was built on \nan existing geological formation. At its base this roughly square 16m hill covers a surface area of about 200 sq meters. In the center of its flat summit is an oval-shaped sunken area, which some sources attribute to early, haphazard, Spanish excavation. The presence of a stone drain in the center, however, has led some archaeologists to believe it was used for water storage. In the past few years, archaeologists have changed their minds. At the time of research, the pyramid was undergoing excavations in various stages; the most recent findings include craniums, assumed to be war trophies, leading archaeologists to believe thepyramid was, in fact, a ceremonial temple.\nNorth of the pyramid is Kalasasaya , a par-\ntially reconstructed 130m-by-120m ritual-platform compound with walls constructed of huge blocks of red sandstone and andes-ite. The blocks are precisely fitted to form a platform base 3m high.

It took several years for the R\u00edo Desaguadero, the lake\u2019s only outlet, to drain the flood waters.\nAlthough evidence of submerged cities \nremains inconclusive, archaeologists are still unearthing exquisite finds around the lake. At Isla Koa, north of Isla del Sol, they found 22 large stone boxes containing a variety of artifacts: a silver llama, some shell figu-rines and several types of incense burners.

Most rainfall occurs in midsummer (December and January).History\nWhen you first glimpse Lake Titicaca\u2019s crystalline, gemlike waters, beneath the looming backdrop of the Cordillera Real in the clear Altiplano light, you\u2019ll understand why pre-Inca people connected it with mystical events. Those early inhabitants of the Altiplano believed that both the sun itself and their bearded, white god-king, Viracocha, had risen out of its mysterious depths. The Incas, in turn, believed that it was the birthplace of their civilization.\nWhen the Spanish arrived in the mid-16th \ncentury, legends of treasure began to sur-face, including the tale that some Incas had flung their gold into the lake to prevent the Spanish carting it off. Distinct fluctuations in the water level of the lake have led treas-ure hunters to speculate that the ruins of ancient cities might lie beneath its surface.\nFrom year to year, changes in the water \nlevel of Lake Titicaca are not uncommon; previous fluctuations may even have inun-dated settlements and ruins. In the floods of 1985\u201386, highways, docks, fields and streets all disappeared beneath the rising \n12-lake-titicaca-bol7.indd   98 12-lake-titicaca-bol7.indd   98 8/12/09   09:34:09 8/12/09   09:34:09", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2190, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1277ffa2-3641-4320-94e9-f9ab0ac1b65c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1277ffa2-3641-4320-94e9-f9ab0ac1b65c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d646fea6-2bfb-4732-a1a4-a8896fa33e27", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "7eb039889387507a6dec47b819ba3ec9739e303dce282dfb6cc19839186db06c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d38f0b2b-78b0-4d4e-8371-d0f7b1c64811", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77cfea2239d89d4e5baff72c60077bde4a65248af00d98938e5ee797e1c7740c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comLAKE TITICACALAKE TITICACA  \u2022\u2022  Copacabana   99\nmost prominent deities included the sun \nand moon (who were considered husband and wife), the earth mother Pachamama and the ambient spirits known as achachi-las and apus. Among the idols erected on \nthe shores of the Manco Capac peninsula was Kota Kahua\u00f1a, also known as Copacahuana (Aymar\u00e1 for \u2018lake view\u2019), an image with the head of a human and the body of a fish.\nOnce the Aymar\u00e1 had been subsumed \ninto the Inca empire, Emperor Tupac Yupanqui founded the settlement of Copacabana as a wayside rest for pilgrims visiting the huaca (shrine) known as Titi Khar\u2019ka (Rock of the Puma; p112), a former site of human sacrifice at the northern end of Isla del Sol.\nBefore the arrival of Spanish priests in \nthe mid-16th century, the Incas had divided local inhabitants into two distinct groups. Those faithful to the empire were known as Haransaya and were assigned positions of power. Those who resisted, the Hurinsaya, were relegated to manual labor. It was a separation that went entirely against the grain of the community-oriented Aymar\u00e1 culture, and the floods and crop failures that befell them in the 1570s were attributed to this social aberration.\nThis resulted in the rejection of the Inca \nreligion, and the partial adoption of Chris-tianity and establishment of the Santuario de Copacabana, which developed into a syncretic mishmash of both traditional and Christian beliefs. The populace elected La Sant\u00edsima Virgen de Candelaria as its patron saint, and established a con-gregation in her honor. Noting the lack of an image for the altar, Francisco Tito Yupanqui, a direct descendant of the Inca emperor, fashioned an image of clay and placed it in the church. However, his rude effort was deemed unsuitable to repre-sent the honored patron of the village and was removed.\nThe sculptor, who was humiliated but \nnot defeated, journeyed to Potos\u00ed to study arts. In 1582 he began carving a wooden image that took eight months to complete. In 1583 La Virgen Morena del Lago  (the \nDark Virgin of the Lake) was installed on the adobe altar at Copacabana, and shortly thereafter the miracles began.

Unfortunately, though, during festival time (p103), and especially during the Festival of Independence (first week of August) and Semana Santa (Easter week), robberies and muggings are as riotous as the reveling. Local people are quick to point the finger at their Peruvian neighbors, who flood into Copacabana on religious pilgrim-ages. But whoever the culprits may be is irrelevant to the victims of crime, usually tourists. Hotels and businesses display strong warnings to travelers to be extra cautious in the days leading up to and in-cluding festivals: don\u2019t carry valuables, take only the money you need, and never go out alone at night.\n12-lake-titicaca-bol7.indd   101 12-lake-titicaca-bol7.indd   101 8/12/09   09:34:10 8/12/09   09:34:10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2929, "end_char_idx": 4029, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59b1d899-f5c7-4c12-8e1c-0cee3bacc6b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "59b1d899-f5c7-4c12-8e1c-0cee3bacc6b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ccb13f9b-ff55-4aa6-a436-a69c5cac041a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "382772484580dcfb1335764fddf61143aede64318cebacdd438e9a2c99a29fc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "082600d8-c382-4440-ab14-b8e582696b1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0172602a64123110407bcc0a0a1cbac0d92f0aa296d6f7daa22ac3cba7f94dd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comLAKE TITICACA102    LAKE TITICACA  \u2022\u2022  Copacabana\nIsla de la Luna (p114), Cha\u2019llapampa (p111) and Las \nIslas Flotantes (see boxed text, p107).

Syndicates, posing as fellow passengers, kidnapped and held tourists bound and blindfolded for over 24 hours while their bank accounts were depleted to the maxi-mum amount permitted. \nIn recent years, this has not occurred but, \nin any case, the smaller minibuses are more dangerous \u2013 they tend to be packed with people and are prone to speed. Travelers are encouraged to take the formal tourist buses (or the larger buses; p106). These drop pas-sengers at major hotels such as those in Calle Illampu, and can be organized through any of the tour agencies in Copacabana. The cost is slightly higher (B$25 to B$30) but is worth the investment.\nTourists should also be especially care-\nful during festivals (see boxed text, p101). Stand well back during fireworks displays, when explosive fun seems to take priority over crowd safety, and be wary of light-fingered revelers.\nThe thin air, characteristically brilliant \nsunshine, and reflection off the water com-bine to admit scorching levels of ultravio-let radiation.

Alternatively, you can buy tickets on the morning of departure (B$20 to B$25) from one of the beach offices. Local community boats (Mallku and Sol Tours) also run less frequent trips. For details, see p103.\nCOPACABANA TO YAMPUPATA\nAn enjoyable way to reach Isla del Sol is to walk or travel in taxi or minibus (p109) along the lakeshore to the village of Y ampu-pata, which lies just a short boat ride from the ruins of Pilko Kaina on Isla del Sol.\nMain Route \nIf walking, this trek is road-bound, making it a fairly hot and hard slog (allow seven hours if you\u2019re stopping along the way), although with lovely views and interesting village visits. Take your own snacks; there\u2019s little, if anything, along the way.\nFrom Copacabana, head northeast on \nthe road around the lake for around 1\u00bd hours until the Gruta de Lourdes  (aka Gruta \nde F\u00e1tima), a cave that for locals evokes images of its French and Portuguese name-sakes, respectively. For a shortcut, turn right immediately after the small bridge lead-ing to the Virgin and follow the Inca path. from La Paz to Copacabana \u2013 including Milton Tours and Combi Tours \u2013 cost from around B$25 to B$30 and are well worth the investment (p102). They depart from La Paz at around 8am and leave Copacabana at 1:30pm (3\u00bd hours). Note, at the time of research, these were departing from the top of 16 de Julio, several blocks south of Plaza Sucre. Tickets can be purchased from tour agencies. \nTO/FROM PERU\nMany tour buses go all the way to Puno (Peru), and you can break the journey in Copacabana and then continue with the same agency. You can do just the Copa\u2013Puno leg (B$30, three to four hours) or go all the way to Cuzco (B$85 to B$150, 15 hours) \u2013 changing buses in Puno. These buses depart and arrive in Copacabana from Av 6 de Agosto.\nAlternatively, catch a public minibus \nfrom Plaza Sucre to the border at Kasani (B$3, 15 minutes). Across the border there\u2019s frequent, if crowded, onward transpor-tation to Yunguyo (five minutes) and Puno (2\u00bd hours). If you\u2019re headed straight to Cuzco, many Copacabana agencies offer tickets on the daily buses. They also offer bus journeys to Arequipa (B$95 8\u00bd hours), Lima (B$400) and other Peruvian destinations. All buses will wait until the last person has completed immigration formalities.\nTREATS BEYOND TOWN\nThrow away the guidebook and discover some of Copa\u2019s wonderful surrounds on your own.\n\u0084 Visit Las Islas Flotantes (floating reed islands), a community project at Sahui\u00f1a, approximately \n6km from Copa, for a delightful spin on one of the most tranquil parts of the lake, in a row boat or a totora-reed boat (B$10 to B$15 per person per island). Hint: take the minibus towards Kasani (B$2.50) and ask to be let off at the entrance (a 10-minute ride). The office is 15 minutes on foot from here, and it\u2019s another 15 minutes to the boats.\n\u0084 Ask the Centro de Informaci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica (p102) for a list of Inca ruins and strike out on your own.

You finish at the beautiful and unspoiled cobblestone village of Sam-\npaya, 5km from Y ampupata. At the time of research, the community was building a series of stylish huts, plus a museum; check their progress with Turisbus at Hotel Rosa-rio del Lago (p105) or Copacabana\u2019s Centro de Informaci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica (p102). You can return on foot to Copacabana via the higher eastern route (four hours). Although this road doesn\u2019t pass through main villages, it affords magnificent views and a more nature-bound experience.\nGetting There & Away\nFor those who don\u2019t want to walk or catch a taxi, the easiest way to travel between Y ampupata and Copacabana is by minibus (B$5, 40 minutes). At the time of research, these were leaving Copacabana from near the market (Monday to Saturday) and from Plaza Sucre (Sunday) at 10am, noon and 5pm; add approximately 40 minutes for the return times from Y ampupata. Times change, however; first check with the mini-bus company 6 de Junio.\nISLA DEL SOL \nThe Island of the Sun was known to early inhabitants as Titi Khar\u2019ka (Rock of the Puma), from which Titicaca takes its name. This island has been identified as the birth-place of several revered entities, including the sun itself. There, the bearded, white god-king Viracocha and the first Incas, Manco Capac and his sister-wife Mama Ocllo, mystically appeared under direct orders from the sun. In fact, most modern-day Aymar\u00e1 and Quechua peoples of Peru and Bolivia accept these legends as their creation story.\nIsla del Sol\u2019s 2500 permanent residents \nare distributed between the main settle-ments of Cha\u2019llapampa, near the island\u2019s northern end; Cha\u2019lla, which backs up to a lovely sandy beach on the central east coast; and Yumani, which straddles the ridge above \nthe Escalera del Inca.\nWith a host of ancient ruins, tiny tra-\nditional villages, beautiful walking routes When the path peters out head directly up-hill to rejoin the main road at the crest of the hill. Note: to save an hour or so and avoid the flat and litter-strewn outskirts of town, you can catch a minibus (B$5) or taxi (one way/return B$40/70) from Copa to the Gruta de Lourdes (9km), from where the more picturesque hiking begins.\nAt the fork just below the crest of the \nhill bear left and descend to the shore and into the village of Titicachi, where, if it\u2019s \nopen, there\u2019s a basic tienda (shop) selling \nsoft drinks. For die-hard archaeologists, in and around Titicachi are some pre-Inca walls and the abandoned Tiahuanacota Inca \ncemetery, but these are not obvious to the visitor. The community currently boasts two privately run floating islands  (B$10 per \nperson per island), although at the time of research the return trip to Isla del Sol with both boat companies incorporated a visit here (check with Centro de Informaci\u00f3n in Copa).\nAt the next village, Sicuani, Juan Mamani \nruns the Hostal Yampu, offering very basic accommodations with bucket showers.

This is known as the Piedra Sagrada  \n(Sacred Stone). There are theories that it was used as an execution block for those convicted of wrongdoing.\nOver the track and in a field, just south-\nwest of the Piedra Sagrada, are the ancient walls of the complex known as the Templo \ndel Inca (or Templo del Sol). Although little \nremains of this temple, built for an un-known purpose, it contains the only Bolivian examples of expert Inca stonework comparable to the renowned walls found in Cuzco. \nCHINCANA RUINS & TITI KHAR\u2019KA\nThe island\u2019s most spectacular ruins com-plex, the  Chincana ruins  \n(admission B$10, see boxed \ntext, opposite) , lies near the island\u2019s northern \ntip. Its main feature is the Palacio del Inca , a \nmaze of stone walls and tiny doorways, also known as El Laberinto (Labyrinth) or by its Aymar\u00e1 name, Inkanakan Utapa. Within the labyrinth there is a small well, believed prominent Kakayo-Que\u00f1a Ridge , the island\u2019s \nsouthwestern extremity. The serene walk along the ridge to the lighthouse  on the \nsouthern tip takes at least half a day (return) from Yumani.\nCHA\u2019LLA\nThis agreeable little village stretches along a magnificent sandy beach that appears to be taken straight out of a holiday brochure for the Greek islands. Note: the village is spread out \u2013 it extends over the hill to the south. There\u2019s a small kiosk and a guest-house, Hostal Qhumphuri (p113).\nIn the pastoral flatlands over the low pass \nbetween Cha\u2019lla (for information about ad-mission fees, see boxed text, opposite) and Yumani is the  Museo \u00c9tnico , with some dusty \nexhibits including Inca pots. It\u2019s an hour\u2019s walk north of Yumani along the lower path (or on the western route if coming from the north). It\u2019s worth it for the stunning bay and valley views; the museum itself is dis-appointing and you will have to ask around to be let in (the B$5 paid at Cha\u2019lla covers admission).\nNorthern Half\nThere are two major routes between the northern and southern ends of Isla del Sol. The lower route winds scenically through fields, hamlets and villages, and around the bays and headlands above the eastern coast. The most commonly used route follows the dramatic ridge path that runs between Cha\u2019llapampa in the north and Yumani in the south. In the north are the Chincana ruins that sit on top of an uninhabited ridge (for information about admission fees, see boxed text, opposite). The views down to both coasts of the island are nothing short of spectacular. \nCHA\u2019LLAP AMP A \nMost boat tours visiting the northern ruins land at Cha\u2019llapampa, which straddles a slender isthmus.\nThe small museum\n (admission B$10) contains \nartifacts excavated in 1992 from Marka Pampa, referred to by locals as La Ciudad Submergida (Sunken City).

Legend has it that the small Island of the Moon was where Viracocha commanded the moon to rise into the sky. A walk up to the eucalyptus grove at the summit, where shepherds graze their flocks, is rewarded by a spectacular vista of aquamarine waters, Cerro Illampu and the entire snow-covered Cordillera Real. It\u2019s lost some popularity in recent times thanks to the aggressive marketing of neighboring Isla del Sol and transportationoperators who stopped heading there, but offers a genuine experience for those who make the effort. \nThe ruins  \n(admission B$10)  of an Inca nun-\nnery for the V\u00edrgenes del Sol (Virgins of the Sun), also known as Acllahuasi or I\u00f1ak Uyu, occupy an amphitheater-like valley on the northeast shore.

In former days, often a sail of reeds was added. These bloated little ca-noes don\u2019t last long as far as watercraft go; after several months of use they become waterlogged and begin to rot and sink.

Its shallow shores are lined with beds of totora  reed, the versatile building material \nfor which Titicaca is famous. By day fisher-folk ply the island\u2019s main bay in their wooden boats; just a few years ago you\u2019d also have seen the totora- reed boats, and \nmen paddling around to gather the reeds to build them, but they are no longer used.\nDuring Inca times, the island served as \na cemetery, and it is still dotted with stone chullpas  (funerary towers) and abandoned \nstone houses. Legends abound about the horrible fate that will befall anyone who desecrates the cemetery, and locals have long refused to live in the area surrounding the island\u2019s only village, Queguaya.\nIsla Pariti\nThis tiny island, surrounded by totora -reed \nmarshes, made world news in 2004 when a team of Bolivian and Finnish archaeologists discovered ancient Tiwanaku ceramics here ENTERING/LEAVING PERU\nMost travelers enter/exit Peru via Copacabana (and the Tiquina Straits) or the scruffy town of \nDesaguadero (avoiding Copacabana altogether). \nVia Copacabana\nMicros  to the Kasani\u2013Yunguyo border leave Copacabana\u2019s Plaza Sucre regularly, usually when \nfull (B$3, 15 minutes). At Kasani you obtain your exit stamp at passport control and head on foot across the border. On the Peruvian side, micros  and taxis will ferry you to Yunguyo (around \n6 Peruvian soles , 15 minutes). From here, you can catch a bus heading to Puno. An efficient \nalternative is to catch a tourist bus from/to La Paz to Puno via Copacabana (from B$60); some allow you a couple of days\u2019 stay in Copacabana. Note: even if you\u2019ve bought a ticket to Cusco or elsewhere in Peru, you\u2019ll change buses in Puno.

It\u2019s an exhilarating descent on a bike and, at the bottom, warm, jungle towns await, perfect for hammock-swinging or pool-lounging.\n13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   11713-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   117 8/12/09   09:29:268/12/09   09:29:26\u00a9 Lonely Planet", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2266, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1590583-aec8-414e-96b5-f02b790c61f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1590583-aec8-414e-96b5-f02b790c61f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b62349e-986d-4d3f-9af2-c1c1513b22f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "35106d8e702cac42be0253f313d24d485432b0fb3247bedb61fa8cc2e91a492d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE CORDILLERAS  \n& YUNGASlonelyplanet.com 118    THE CORDILLERAS & YUNGAS  \u2022\u2022  History\nprotestors angry at the selling of the nation\u00b4s \nnatural resources (principally gas) and the mistreatment of the indigenous population. More than 100 tourists found themselves trapped in the town of Sorata for over a week during the demonstrations, until a misguided military mission was launched to \u2018rescue\u2019 them, sparking violent clashes that left six people dead. The fall-out from the violence and the mismanagement of the situation led to the resignation of S\u00e1nchez de Lozada and ultimately to the election of Evo Morales, a former coca farmer.\nThe sweet Yungas\u2019 coca is the most often \nconsumed in Bolivia and as a result, the region has been at the forefront of Morales\u2019s \u2018coca revolution\u2019 with the cocaleros (coca \nfarmers) finding themselves newly empow-ered as a political force. However, they have been unable to find a united voice, with two main factions forming; Las Proteccionistas ,\nthe more established highland farmers who want to defend the localized economy, and the more numerous Nacionalistas,  from \nnewly colonised lower altitude areas who seek to expand the coca economy. Las \nProteccionistas  claim that coca is the only \nviable crop at the altitudes at which they live and that Morales\u2019s policies actually threaten their livelihoods by opening coca cultivation up to the multitudes. \nClimate\nThe Yungas\u2019 physical beauty is astonishing,and although the hot, humid and rainy climatemay induce lethargy, it\u2019s nevertheless more agreeable to most people than the chilly Altiplano. Winter rains are gentle, and the heavy rains occur mainly between Novemberand March. The average year-round tempera-ture hovers in the vicinity of 18\u00b0C, but summer daytime temperatures in the 30s aren\u2019t uncommon. As a result, the region pro-v ides a balmy retreat for chilled highlanders, and is a favorite R&R hangout for foreign travelers. The mountains of the cordilleras, on the other hand, are serious, lofty beasts and conditions can be extreme, with warm days, and nights that drop well below zero.\nGetting There & Around\nAccess is entirely overland and the region\u2019s unpaved roads can get mucky and washed out in the rainy season. Scheduled public trans-portation is infrequent to many trekkingHistory\nThe first settlers of the Yungas were inspired by economic opportunity. In the days of the Inca empire, gold was discovered in the Tipuani and Mapiri valleys, and the gold-crazed Spanish immediately got in on the act. To enrich the royal treasury, they forced locals to labor for them, and the region became one of the continent\u2019s most prolific producers of gold. Today the rivers of the lower Yungas are ravaged by hordes of wild-cat prospectors and bigger mining outfits. \nDuring October 2003, in what were to \nbe the dying days of President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada\u00b4s government, the Yungas was the scene of roadblocks and violent clashes between police, the military and campesino  \n13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   118 13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   118 8/12/09   09:29:27 8/12/09   09:29:27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3087, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acc21cac-625d-4f2d-9fdc-0fa5adc42320": {"__data__": {"id_": "acc21cac-625d-4f2d-9fdc-0fa5adc42320", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a73fc9f5-ba39-484d-9dc4-c0a646f48c38", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "335b1c59ded1bd2fc81f503cf30e3d9eae823e9a0121eecee8ef356085a98565", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4aefc1a8-5305-4686-99ca-d8f2a9247d3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1bd2bac110d47ab314609ec06e2f059a786573348afa6d49a0b7d3425cef00d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE CORDILLERAS  \n& YUNGASlonelyplanet.com THE YUNGAS  \u2022\u2022  Coroico   119\nhill-walking around here is more strolling \nthan trekking, which appeals to stiff-legged hikers from the Choro trail or those nursing bruised bottoms after the hectic mountain-bike descent from La Paz. \nCoroico is relatively warm year-round, \nbut summer storms bring some mighty downpours.

The following descriptions of the most prominent rides should start your wheels spinning. For further information on mountain biking in Bolivia, as well as choosing an operator, see p57 and p74.\n\u2018The World\u2019s Most Dangerous Road\u2019 \u2013 La Cumbre to Coroico\nQuite deservedly this ride is Bolivia\u2019s most popular, made so by travelers wishing to combine a long and thrilling downhill run with a very appealing destination. It features an incredible range of scenery and a spectacular 3600m descent from the Altiplano, down between snow-capped peaks into the steaming Yungas. The dramatic, cliff-hugging descent is billed as \u2018The World\u2019s Most Dangerous Road,\u2019 though now that motorized traffic uses the new Coroico road it is quite a lot safer than it once was. That said, choose your operator carefully: accidents do happen and not all companies are prepared for them \u2013 cheaper does not mean better.\nAfter this thrilling day trip, riders can relax poolside in the quiet Yungas town of Coroico. \nFrom here, it\u2019s possible to continue to Rurrenabaque, in the Amazon Lowlands, or return to La Paz on public transportation.\nTo reach La Cumbre from La Paz, catch any Yungas-bound transportation from Villa F\u00e1tima. \nMany La Paz\u2013based agencies offer this as an organized day trip, either leaving you in Coroico or taking you back to La Paz.\nSorata\nSorata is not only Bolivia\u2019s trekking capital but it\u2019s also saturated with mountain-biking opportunities,and the fun begins with a descent into the town from the mountains astride Lake Titicaca. From La Paz, take a Sorata-bound bus to the pass north of Achacachi and then choose either the main road or any of the downhill routes along unpaved roads. Most routes eventually lead to Sorata \u2013 or at least in view of it (but some don\u2019t, so it\u2019s wise to have a map). Throughout the ride you\u2019re presented with superb views of towering snow-capped peaks, plunging valleys and tiny rural villages. This route is organized (as are others) by Andean Epics (p135).\nZongo Valley\nThis ride includes a descent from the base of spectacular Huayna Potos\u00ed (6088m) past Zongo Dam, and then along a dramatic 40km, 3600m descent into the lush and humid Yungas. This is a dead-end road that lacks a great destination at its finish, but there\u2019s little vehicular traffic, so you tend to have the road to yourself and can open up the throttle a little more. \nChacaltaya to La Paz\nThis trip begins with a drive up to the world\u2019s highest developed ski slope at 5345m. After taking in the incredible view across the Cordillera Real, riders descend along abandoned mine roads.

Although the junctionfor the Chulumani road is at Unduavi, fewpassing micros  have spare seats at this point.\nEL CHORO TREK\nThe La Cumbre to Coroico (Choro) trek, \nwhich traverses Parque Nacional Cotopata, is one of Bolivia\u2019s premier hikes. It begins at La Cumbre (4725m), the highest point on the La Paz\u2013Coroico highway, and climbs to 4859m before descending 3250m into the humid Yungas and the village of Chairo. Along the 57km route (which is in the best condition during the April to September dry season), you\u2019ll note a rapid change in climate, vegetation and wildlife as you leave the Altiplano and plunge into the forest. \nEnergetic hikers can finish the trek in \ntwo days, but it\u2019s a demanding walk more comfortably done in three days. Many people allow even more time, or organize a stay of a few days in the albergue  (basic \naccommodation) at Sandillani.\nPrepare for a range of climates. It can be \npretty cold, even snowy, on the first day, but you\u2019ll soon be in sweatier climes. For the lower trail, light cotton trousers will protect your legs from sharp vegetation and biting insects. The Inca paving can be pretty slip-pery, so make sure you\u2019ve got shoes with grip.\nDangers & Annoyances\nTravelers have occasionally been robbed doing this trek solo, with most thefts reportedbelow Choro village. Though these appear to be isolated incidents, it\u2019s a better idea to go days, this home-style, candlelit restaurant is still a good choice for its friendly manage-ment and selection of fondue and \u00e0 la carte  \nmeals. There are also small but tasty steaks, pasta dishes and a range of scrumptious pancakes. For the sweet of tooth, the sinful chocolate fondue is the way forward.\nDrinking\nAfter midnight, with the resto-bars shut, it\u2019stime for Murcielaguitos  \n(% 7122-9830; Pacheco\ns/n; h Fri & Sat night) , in the Residencial 20 de \nOctubre, where students from the agriculturalcollege join others to dance to loud Latin music and sing karaoke. If you prefer to letthe professionals do the singing then tryBar Mosquito \n(Sag\u00e1rnaga s/n; h 6pm onwards)  where \nyou can play pool and enjoy the two-for-one happy hour.\nShopping\nFor quality handmade jewelry visit Artesan\u00edas\nArco Iris , on the south side of the plaza. It isn\u2019t \ncheap, but most items are unique. During the high season the plaza is frequented by itinerant craftspeople selling a wide range of artesan\u00edas  (locally handcrafted items).\nFor natural and organic produce Blue Pine \nFarm is just off the plaza on Tom\u00e1s Monye. \nThe Madres de Clarisa Convent\n (h 8am-8pm)  sells \nhomemade brownies, orange cakes, creativelyflavored biscuits, and wines.

In former times it was an Aymar\u00e1 sanctuary, being replaced by the Christ monument in the colonial era. From here, follow the well-defined track to your left for 1km then turn off onto the smaller track that turns right and passes between two small ponds (one often dry). Follow it up the hill until it curves to the left and begins to descend.\nAt this point follow the light track leading \nup the gravelly hill to your right and toward an obvious notch in the barren hill before you. This is Abra Chucura (4859m), and from \nhere the trail tends downhill all the way to its end at Chairo. At the high point is a pile of stones called Apacheta Chucura . For centuries\ntravelers have marked their passing by tossing a stone atop it (preferably one that has been carried from a lower elevation) asan offering to the mountain apus  (spirits).\nAn hour below Abra Chucura lie the remains of a tambo  (wayside inn) dating \nfrom Inca times.\nOne hour below the tambo is the hamlet\nof Estancia Sama\u00f1a Pampa , where there\u2019s a store \nselling water, a grassy campsite, a shelterand another registration hut.\nA short way further on, basic supplies are \navailable at the village of Chucura  (Achura, \n3600m). Here you pay a toll of B$10 for maintenance of the trail: you will notice the difference it makes as you head on. An hour\u2019s walk from here leads to some camp-sites (B$10 per person), which are found with a guide. Camp out of sight if possible and do not leave anything outside your tent. \nTours\nA growing number of La Paz outfits offer organized El Choro treks. Most include meals, guides and camping equipment; some \ninclude the services of porters. For suggestionsof agencies, see p74 and p350.\nAccess\nOnce you find the trailhead, the trail is easy to access and follow. From Villa F\u00e1tima in La Paz, catch any Yungas-bound transpor-tation and ask to be dropped at La Cumbre, marked by a statue of Christ, where the trek begins. \nThe road climbs steeply out of Villa \nF\u00e1tima, and less than an hour out of La Paz at the 4725m crest of the La Paz\u2013Yungas road is La Cumbre. For the best chance of good clear views of the stunning scenery, start as early as possible, before the mist rises out of the Yungas.\nYou can also take a taxi to the trail (30 \nminutes). One advantage of this is that they can take you up the first bit to the pass atAbra Chucura, thus avoiding the initialclimb if you think it might cause you altitude problems.\nThe Route\nAt the statue of Christ  is a park registration \noffice where you should sign in.

There, \nyou\u2019ll find the apacheta  (shrine of stones) \nand a spectacular view of Nevado Muru-rata (5868m) to the right and the plunging valleys of the Yungas far below.

The town was founded because of thesupposed healing qualities of the mineral streams in the vicinity, but with the fertilesoils providing bumper crops of coca (the country\u2019s best for chewing), citruses, bananas, coffee and cacao it soon became more important as a trade center for the nearby farming communities. The area is also a paradise for birds and butterflies, with clouds of the latter, and several endemic spe-cies of the former. At a tropically warm and often wet altitude, it\u2019s a great trekking base camp and a relaxing weekend retreat with a great view. The only time Chulumani breaks its pervasive tranquility is during the week following August 24, when it stages the riotous Fiesta de San Bartolom\u00e9 . \nDuring the 1781 La Paz revolt, rebels \nescaped to the Yungas and hid out in the valleys around Chulumani. Today the area is home to a large population of African-Bolivians (see the boxed text, p131).\nInformation\nChulumani\u2019s tourist office is in a kiosk on the main plaza, but if you are thinking of exploring the region it is worth seeking out hotel owners such as English-speak-ing Javier Sarabia at the Country House (p130). There\u2019s no ATM in Chulumanni; Banco Uni\u00f3n changes traveler\u2019s checks for 5% commission, and Prodem changes US dollars and gives cash advances on credit cards (5% commission).

From\nthere the route descends to the final crossingof the R\u00edo Takesi via a concrete bridge, marking the end of the pre-Columbian trail. It\u2019s then a 1\u00bd-hour trudge along an aqueduct\nto the ramshackle mining settlement of Mina Chojlla  (2280m), where there is a cheap \nalojamiento  (basic accommodation). \nFrom Mina Chojlla, crowded buses leave \nfor Y anacachi (B$3, 30 minutes) and La Paz (B$12, four hours) at 5:30am and 1pm daily \u2013 buy your ticket on arrival. If you can\u2019t endure a night in Mina Chojlla (and few people can), keep about one hour down the road past the headquarters of the hydro-electric power project to the more pleasant village of Yanacachi .\nYUNGA CRUZ TREK\nThis is a relatively little-trodden trek be-\ntween the village of Chu\u00f1avi and the Sud Yungas\u2019 provincial capital of Chulumani.

On the way back, you pass through tiny, postcard-pretty Ocabaya, which has one \nof the oldest churches in Bolivia, fronted \nby a liberty bell and a memorial to two local martyrs in the struggle for campesino  \n(subsistence farmer) rights. Locals may well offer food in their homes here.\nJavier Sarabia at the Country House in \nChulumani (p130) will happily give walking information (even for nonguests) and can help arrange taxi drop-offs or pick-ups.\nWhitewater Rafting\nThe road to Chulumani follows part of another good whitewater river, the R\u00edo \nUnduavi. The upper section ranges from essentially unnavigable Class V to Class VI, with steep chutes, powerful currents, large boulder gardens, blind corners and water-falls. Beyond this section it mellows out into some challenging Class IV whitewater followed by Class II and III rapids. Access is limited, but the Chulumani road does offer several put-ins and take-outs. The best access points have been left by construction crews who\u2019ve mined the riverbanks for sand and gravel. A good take-out point is Puente Villa, which is three to four hours below the best put-ins.\nSleeping\nAs well as a few cheap alojamientos (the \nSarita on the main street is the cleanest), Irupana has a couple of interesting accom-modations options.

It will likely be standing-room only; if a seat is a priority, you\u2019ll have to go all the way back to La Paz.\nIt\u2019s also possible to go to Coroico via \nCoripata; take a La Paz-bound bus and get off at the crossroads just after Puente Villa at Km 93. Here, wait for a bus or cami\u00f3n  \nto Coripata and then change again for a lift to Coroico. It\u2019s a lo-o-o-ng and dusty but worthwhile trip. An easier option is to hire a taxi; expect to pay B$300 for the trip to Coroico for up to four people.\nAROUND CHULUMANI\nThe area around Chulumani is a beautiful, fertile zone comprised both of patches of forest and of farms producing coca, coffee, bananas and citrus fruits.

Just after the bridge, a left turn heads away from the main road up a steep hill to Laza. A via crucis (Stations of \nthe Cross) leads up to the pretty square and its church, where there\u2019s an appealing dark-wood and gold altarpiece and baldachin.The much-revered statue of Christ, El Se\u00f1or \nde la Exaltaci\u00f3n, is the destination for an important romer\u00eda  (pilgrimage-fiesta) on \nSeptember 14.\nThe main settlement over this side of the \nriver is Irupana, an attractive, sleepy colonial town founded in the 18th century on one of the few bits of flat ground in the area.

Though there isn\u2019t much to do in town, it\u2019s a great spot to just chill for a few days, and a popular base camp for hikers and mountain-bikers.\nIn colonial days Sorata provided a link \nto the Alto Beni\u2019s goldfields and rubber plantations, and a gateway to the Amazon Basin. In 1791 it was the site of a distinctly unorthodox siege by indigenous leader Andr\u00e9s Tupac Amaru and his 16,000 soldiers.They constructed dykes above the town, and when these had filled with runoff from the slopes of Illampu, they opened the flood-gates and the town was washed away.\nIn September 2003, Sorata hit the national\nheadlines. A blockade further up the La Paz road, expression of an overwhelming wave of campesino  dissatisfaction that eventually\nled to the downfall of the government, trapped hundreds of Bolivian and foreign tourists in Sorata. In a misplaced show of force, the army busted them out, killing a campesino  and inducing a riot.

The Jach\u2019a Avalancha (Grande Avalanche) Mountain Bike race takes place in Sorata each year. This is the biggest downhill race course in South America based on the Mega Avalanche format. It is a 2000m descent using a mass start and draws riders from across Bolivia and the world.\no Andean Epics Ride Company (% 7127-\n6685; www.andeanepics.com; inside Lagunas) is a pro-\nfessional and enthusiastic set-up that offers a range of great mountain-bike trips for ridersof all levels. These range from sedate half-dayexcursions to awesome multiday adventuresin the surrounding sierras. Owner Travis isalways building downhill trails and plottingout new routes; one of his specialties is afive-day trip from Sorata to Rurrenabaque,starting with a two-day ride from Sorata toMapiri via Consata (descending over4000m from the starting point in themountains), followed by a three-day boatjourney with hikes as side-trips. The tripleaves every Monday from Sorata and costsB$1400. A minimum of four people isrequired for the longer rides; prices are fromB$350 to B$500 per ride. The season is fromApril to December \u2013 it\u2019s too muddy at other times, but other rides are available year-round. Full-day downhill trips around Sorata cost around B$500 per person. \n13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   135 13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   135 8/12/09   09:29:30 8/12/09   09:29:30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2989, "end_char_idx": 4688, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38329e3c-0aa2-4a5b-a944-63ffbef15849": {"__data__": {"id_": "38329e3c-0aa2-4a5b-a944-63ffbef15849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87bdf54f-83ce-4493-8344-f9b84cd15856", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "35d0d10f92c2aff6f253fe0cdab622f467212914f5ef8a01656551ec996e29d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "44f6d57c-25a2-434f-879e-d2d94c6dc355", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c0e5eb07c50054dc1d100e18dcc341f50080fab8df43a9798fc74ab0a0452dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE CORDILLERAS  \n& YUNGASBook your stay at lonelyplanet.com/hotels 136    THE YUNGAS  \u2022\u2022  El Camino del Oro (Gold Digger\u2019s Trail)\nDrinking & Entertainment\nNot a lot goes on in Sorata at night. The \nSpider Bar on the plaza (its name is taken from a former bar of that name) has a decent drinks selection and outdoor seating, but shuts fairly early. Lagunas has a worldly vibe and offers vegetarian dishes as well as beer, cocktails and homemade liquor.\nGetting There & Away\nSorata is a long way from the other Yungas towns, and there\u2019s no road connecting it directly with Coroico, so you must go through La Paz. \nFrom La Paz, Trans Unificado Sorata \n(% 238-\n1693) and Perla del Illampu each leave hourly \nfrom Manuel Bustillos with Angel Babaia between 4am and 5:30pm (B$15, three hours).

For Copacabana you must get off at the junction town of Huarina and wait for another, probably packed, bus. Similarly, for Charazani you should change at Achacachi, but you\u2019ll need to start out from Sorata very early. \nThe only road route between Sorata and \nthe lowlands is a rough 4WD track that leads to the gold-mining settlement of Mapiri. It strikes out from Sorata and passes through Quiabaya, Tacacoma and Consata, roughly following the courses of the R\u00edos Llica, Consata and Mapiri all the way. The biggestdrawbacks are the horrendous mud, the road construction and some river crossings that are passable only with a 4WD. Camionetas  \n(pick up trucks) leave Sorata sporadically for the grueling journey to Consata (seven hours) andon to the Sorata Limitada mine  (10 hours). From Sorata Limitada, you\u2019ll \nfind camionetas to Mapiri, which is another \nhour away.\nEL CAMINO DEL ORO\n(GOLD DIGGER\u2019S TRAIL)\nFor nearly 1000 years t his Inca road has \nbeen used as a commerce and trade link between the Altiplano and the lowland goldfields.

Another Inca-engineered diversion to the north bank has been destroyed by bridge washouts, forcing a spontaneously constructed, but thankfully brief, detour above the southern bank.\nJust past the detour is the village of Sumata ;\njust beyond, a trail turns off to the north across the river and heads for Yani, which is \nthe start of the Mapiri trail. A short distance further along from the trail junction is Ocara . \nFrom here, the path goes up the slope \u2013 don\u2019t follow the river. After 1\u00bd hoursyou\u2019ll reach Lambromani , where a local may \nask you to pay B$3 per person to pass. You can camp here in the schoolyard.\nAn hour past Lambromani you\u2019ll reach \nWainapata , where the vegetation grows \nthicker and more lush. Here, the route splits (to rejoin at Pampa Quillapituni); the upper route is very steep and dangerous, so the lower one is preferable. A short distance along, the lower route passes through an interesting tunnel drilled through the rock. There\u2019s a popular myth that it dates from Inca times, but it was actually made with dynamite and likely blasted out early in the 20th century by the Aramayo mining com-pany to improve the access to the Tipuani goldfields. At Pampa  Quillapituni , 30 minutes \nbeyond, is a favorable campsite. Just east of this, a trail branches off to the right toward Calzada Pass, several days away on the Il-lampu circuit.\nFour hours after crossing the swinging \nbridge at the R\u00edo Cooc\u00f3 , you\u2019ll reach the little \nsettlement of Mina Yuna , where you can pick \nup basic supplies, and it\u2019s possible to camp on the soccer field.\nAn hour further down is Chusi , which is \nfour hours before your first encounter with the road. There\u2019s no place to camp here, but you can stay in the school. Puente Nairapi , \nover the R\u00edo Grande de Y avia, is a good place for a swim to take the edge off the increasing heat.\nOnce you reach the road, the scene grows \nincreasingly depressing. For a final look at relatively unaffected landscape, follow the shortcut trail, which begins with a steep Inca staircase  and winds up at Baja Llipi  and and scrape the landscape and dump the \ndetritus, which is picked over by out-of-work Aymar\u00e1 refugees from the highlands. Fortunately, the upper part of the route remains magnificent, and almost every-thing between Ancoma and Chusi has been left alone, including some wonderfully exhausting Inca staircases and dilapidated ancient highway engineering. \nThis trek is more challenging than the \nTakesi and El Choro routes; if you want to get the most from it, plan on six or seven days to walk between Sorata and Llipi, less if you opt for a 4WD to Ancoma. At Llipi, find transportation to Tipuani or Guanay to avoid a walking-pace tour through the worst of the destruction.\nAccess\nNearly everyone does the route from Sorata down the valley to Tipuani and Guanay, simply because it\u2019s generally downhill. If you don\u2019t mind a climb, however, you might prefer to do it in reverse, thus leaving the prettiest bits to last. Whatever you choose to do, it is best with a guide.\nThere are three options for the route \nbetween Sorata and Ancoma. First, you can rent a 4WD in Sorata and cut two days off the trek. You\u2019ll have to bargain but expect to pay at least B$350. A challenging alternative is the steep route that begins near the ceme-tery in Sorata. The route roughly follows the R\u00edo Challasuyo, passing through the village of Chillkani and winding up on the road just below the Abra Chuchu (4658m) \u2013 this is also the access to the Mapiri trail (p138), a four-hour walk from Ancoma.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "102daeb4-980c-4b11-ba01-6642d9e721cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "102daeb4-980c-4b11-ba01-6642d9e721cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12b60643-6065-4644-9e08-68802e8a8cde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "3db54f5b55fdffd0d950cc27bc37582ee05a36552935f5656d9e66c6f9b31d70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a707c6a-b5c2-407b-97f1-3a446e19089f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "1fe54c38a6561c31e05ff9821019cfbcda6bd878f33ef6c73614188def64cdc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If you don\u2019t mind a climb, however, you might prefer to do it in reverse, thus leaving the prettiest bits to last.

It \ncan be reached either by 4WD from Sorata (around B$350 for five people, three to four hours) or on foot over Abra Chuchu  \n(4658m). For the latter, start at the cemetery in Sorata and follow the track up past the tiny settlements of Manzanani and Huaca Milluni to the larger village of Chillkani, about three hours beyond Sorata. From there you have five hours of fairly relent-less climbing of the semiforested slopes to the Abra Chuchu. You\u2019ll meet up with the road twisting 4km below the pass.\nShortly after the crest, take the left turn \n\u2013 the route straight on leads to Ancoma and El Camino del Oro trek (p136) \u2013 down toward a small lake. This route will take you over Paso Lechasani (4750m) and down past Mina Suerte to Ingenio and the start of the Mapiri trail at 3550m.\nThe Route\nPast Ingenio you\u2019ll cross the R\u00edo Yani . Here the\ntrail starts downstream, but half an hour later it cuts uphill along a side stream; there\u2019s a good campsite where it crosses the stream. The path then twists uphill for 1\u00bd hours over a 4000m  pass. In the next two \nhours you\u2019ll cross three more ridges, then descend past Cueva C\u00f3ndor , a cave that is also a\ngood campsite, to a small lake. From the lake the route ascends to Paso Apacheta Nacional\n(3940m), then twists down El Tornillo , a cork-\nscrew-like track that drops 150m. In under an hour you\u2019ll cross the R\u00edo Mamarani , where a \ngood campsite is protected by large rocks.\nThe next campsite lies three hours further\nalong, beside a stream-crossing at the foot of the next big ascent. At the next stream, 30 minutes later (collect water here!), is another  campsite. Here the trail climbs a \nlong staircase, then descends into another valley before climbing to the next pass, Abra the Puente de Tora  toll bridge (B$2) over the \nR\u00edo Santa  Ana.\nAfter crossing the bridge, climb up the hill\nand hope for a camioneta  or 4WD to take you \nto Tipuani  and Guanay . Camionetas  between \nthe R\u00edo Santa Ana bridge and Unutuluni  cost \nB$5 per person; to continue on to Tipuani or Guanay costs an additional B$15.\nYou can pick up basic supplies at Ancoma,\nWainapata, Mina Yuna, Chusi and Llipi, as well as at all the lower settlements along the road. Spartan accommodations may be found in Unutuluni, Chima (rough-and-ready and not recommended), Tipuani and Guanay, all of which are along the road.\nMAPIRI TRAIL\nA longer and more adventurous alternative to the El Camino del Oro trek is the six- to seven-day pre-Hispanic Mapiri trail, which was upgraded 100 years ago by the Richter family in Sorata to connect their headquar-ters with the cinchona  (quinine) plantations \nof the upper Amazon Basin.\nIt\u2019s a tough, demanding trek with a lot of\nphysical exertion besides mere walking \u2013 expect to clamber over and under logs, hack at vegetation with a machete, get assaulted by insects and destroy formerly decentclothing!

There are a number of routes to the top; the one described below is the North Peak route, the most popular with visitors and tour companies. It\u2019s appealing because it can be climbed by beginners with a competent guide and technical equipment. Beginners yes, but fit beginners; it\u2019s quite steep toward the end and it\u2019s a tough climb.\nThough some people attempt to climb \nHuayna Potos\u00ed in one day, it is not recom-mended. It\u2019s a 1500m vertical climb from Paso Zongo (the trailhead, and a mountain pass, situated at 4700m) and a 2500m verti-cal altitude gain from La Paz to the summit. To ascend in one day would pose a great risk of potentially fatal cerebral edema. It\u2019s far more sensible to spend a night at the trailhead, head up to the base camp (5200m) the next day, then make your attempt on the summit that next night.\nThere are two refugios  in the Paso Zongo \narea; the better-equipped is Huayna Potos\u00ed \nRefugio  \n(% in La Paz 2-245-6717; dm low/high season \nincl breakfast B$50/70) . Run by a La Paz tour \ncompany, it\u2019s a comfortable, heated spot and a fine place to acclimatize \u2013 there\u2019s pretty walking to be done hereabouts and plenty of advice and good cheer. Reserve ahead. The other, Refugio San Calixto  \n(Casa Blanca; dm B$40) ,\nis right by the La Paz\u2013Zongo road (buses will let you off outside) and is a simpler, but very hospitable spot. You can also camp here. Transportation to the refugios,\nguides, rations and porters can be arranged through most La Paz tour agencies.\nAccess\nA 4WD from La Paz to the trailhead at Paso Zongo costs around B$500 for up to five people. A taxi should be a bit less with CORDILLERA REAL\nBolivia\u2019s Royal Range has more than 600 peaks over 5000m, most of which are relatively accessible and many of which are just a few hours\u2019 drive from the nation\u2019s capital. They\u2019re also still free of the grow-ing bureaucracy attached to climbing and trekking in the Himalayas. The following section is a rundown of the more popularclimbs in the Cordillera Real, but it is by no means an exhaustive list. There are many other peaks to entice the experienced climber, and whether you choose one of those described here or one of the lesser known, climbing in the Bolivian Andes is always an adventure.\nThe best season for climbing in the \nCordillera Real is May to September. Note that most of the climbs described here are technical and require climbing experience, a reputable climbing guide and proper technical equipment. You should be fully acclimatized to the altitude before attempt-ing any of these ascents. For information on Bolivian mountaineering, see p54.

Prices start at around B$800 for an ascent of Huayna Potos\u00ed, but are significantly higher for the more technical climbs \u2013 say, B$3000-plus for Illimani. Several agencies and foreign climbing-tour agents offer packages that combine ascents of several of the Cordillera Real peaks. See p350 for more information.

Although it\u2019s not a difficult climb technically, the combination of altitude and ice conditions warrants serious consider-ation and caution. Technical equipment is essential above the snow line; caution is especially needed on the exposed section immediately above Nido de C\u00f3ndores where several climbers have perished.\nAccess\nThe easiest way to reach the first Illimani camp, Puente Roto , is via Estancia  Unni, a \nthree-hour trip by 4WD from La Paz (about B$850). From there, it\u2019s three to four hours\u2019 walk to Puente Roto. At Estancia Unni  you \ncan hire porters and mules for around B$150 to carry your gear to Puente Roto or to the high camp at Nido  de C\u00f3ndores. It is \na wise investment.\nA daily 5am bus (B$10) goes from near \nLa Paz\u2019s Mercado Rodr\u00edguez to the village of Quilihuaya , from where you\u2019ll have a two-\nhour slog to Estancia Unni \u2013 complete with a 400m elevation gain. Buses return from Quilihuaya to La Paz several days a week at around 8:30am, but if you\u2019re relying on public transportation you should carry extra food just in case.\nAn alternative route to the base camp \nis via Cohoni . Buses and camiones  leave La \nPaz for Cohoni (B$30, five hours) in the early afternoon Monday to Saturday from the corner of General Luis Lara and Calle Boquer\u00f3n. They leave Cohoni to return to La Paz around 8:30am and may take any-where from five hours to all day depending on which route is followed.\nThe Route\nThe normal route to Pico  Sur, the highest of \nIllimani\u2019s five summits, is straightforward but heavily crevassed. If you don\u2019t have technical glacier experience, hire a competentprofessional guide.\nThe route to Nido de C\u00f3ndores , a rock \nplatform beside the glacier, is a four- to haggling \u2013 make sure your driver knows the way. Daily Trans Zongo buses leave at 6am from Plaza Ballivi\u00e1n in El Alto (B$13, two hours). \nAs Huayna Potos\u00ed is so popular, lots of \nclimbers are headed out that way during the climbing season. If you only want a lift, check with specialist climbing agencies. Someone will probably have a 4WD going on the day you want, and you can share costs for the trip.\nThe Route\nFrom the Refugio  Huayna Potos\u00ed , cross \nthe dam and follow the aqueduct until you reach the third path on your left signed \u2018Glacier Huayna Poto \u015b.\u2019 Take this path to a \nglacial stream then through and across the rocks to reach the ridge of a moraine. Near the end of the moraine descend slightly to your right and then ascend the steep scree gullies. At the top, bear left and follow the cairns to reach the Campo Rocas Glacier  \n(5200m). There\u2019s a hut to sleep in, and dry places to camp. Most tours stop here for the night, before commencing the ascent at around 2am. Other people choose to continue to Campo Argentino.\nThe glacier is crevassed, especially after \nJuly, so rope up while crossing it. Ascend the initial slopes then follow a long, gradu-ally ascending traverse to the right, before turning left and climbing steeply to a flat area between 5500m and 5700m known as Campo Argentino . It will take you about \nfour hours to reach this point.

Either route will bring you to the summit in five to seven hours from Campo Argentino.\n13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   142 13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   142 8/12/09   09:29:31 8/12/09   09:29:31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2932, "end_char_idx": 4388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c69ba63-0b73-47fc-9a61-a08573b211fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c69ba63-0b73-47fc-9a61-a08573b211fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "576987e5-fff6-4bdf-8d5b-39fcfa6d496a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "ec15b136e182058cfcad5afa4bb4a4e4e2d5a46c47a099e9ed372a9a46e86f09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bcf5170f-95ea-4340-b9fd-17243a4ddcad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efc527adeab994a2ce6e89d576f31fa313d5e543ede78c613895ba0d83d3d78f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE CORDILLERAS  \n& YUNGASlonelyplanet.com CORDILLERA REAL  \u2022\u2022  Condoriri Massif   143\nPeque\u00f1o Alpamayo, can be attempted by \nbeginners with a competent guide.\nAccess\nThere is no public transportation from La Paz to Condoriri. A 4WD to the start of the walk-in at the dam at Laguna Tuni  costs \naround B$550. If you don\u2019t want to use a 4WD transfer, you can trek the 24km from Milluni to the Laguna Tuni dam on the road to Paso Zongo. Take everything you will need with you as there is nowhere to buy provisions once you begin the trek.\nIt isn\u2019t possible to drive beyond the dam \nbecause there\u2019s a locked gate across the road. Some drivers know a way around it, but if you need to hire pack animals you\u2019ll have to do so before you reach the dam. Locals charge B$50 per day for mules, and a bit less for llamas, which can carry less. You also might have to sign into the Parque Nacional Condoriri.\nFrom Laguna Tuni, a rough road circles \nsouth around the lake and continues up a drainage trending north. Once you\u2019re in this valley, you\u2019ll have a view of the Cabeza del C\u00f3ndor and Las Alas.\nThe Route\nFrom the end of the road, follow the obviouspaths up along the right side of the valleyuntil you reach a large lake, Chiar Khota . \nFollow the right shore of the lake to arriveat the base camp , which is an easy three \nhours from Laguna Tuni.\nLeave base camp at about 8am and follow\nthe path up the north-trending valley through boulders and up the slope of a moraine. Bear to the left here and descend slightly to reach the flat part of the glacier above the seriously crevassed section. You should reach this point in about 1\u00bd hours from base camp.\nHere you should rope up and put on \ncrampons. Head left across the glacier before rising to the col (lowest point of the \nridge), taking care to avoid the crevasses. Climb to the right up the rock-topped summit Tarija (5240m), which affords \nimpressive views of Peque\u00f1o Alpamayo, before dropping down a scree and rock slope to rejoin a glacier on the other side. From there, either climb directly up the ridge to the summit or follow a climbing traverse to the left before cutting back to six-hour slog up a rock ridge from Puente Roto. There\u2019s no water at Nido de C\u00f3ndores,so you\u2019ll have to melt snow \u2013 bring sufficientstove fuel.\nFrom Nido de C\u00f3ndores you need to set \noff at about 2am. Follow the path in the snow leading uphill from the camp; the path grows narrower and steeper, then flattens out a bit before becoming steeper again. It then crosses a series of crevasses before ascending to the right to reach a level section.From here, aim for the large break in the skyline to the left of the summit, takingcare to avoid the two major crevasses, and cross one steep section that is iced over from July onwards. After you pass through the skyline break, turn right and continue up onto the summit ridge. The final three vertical meters involve walking 400m along the ridge at over 6400m elevation.\nPlan on six to 10 hours for the climb from \nNido de C\u00f3ndores to the summit and three to four hours to descend back to camp.\nIf possible continue down from Nido de \nC\u00f3ndores to Puente Roto on the same day. The 1000m descent is not appreciated after a long day, but your body will thank you the following day and will recover more quickly at the lower altitude. You\u2019ll also avoid having to melt snow for a second night.\nOn the fourth day you can walk from \nPuente Roto back out to Estancia Unni in about two to three hours.\nCONDORIRI MASSIF\nThe massif known as Condoriri is actually a cluster of 13 peaks ranging in height from 5100m to 5648m.

Mountain-eers in particular will find a wonderland of tempting peaks, first ascents and new routes to discover, and the trek from Lagunillas to Agua Blanca \u2013 with magnifi-cent Andean landscapes \u2013 is one of the most memorable in the country.\nWhile access is improving, it must be \nemphasized that this is an isolated region, \nand far from set up for tourism. There are few services, transportation isn\u2019t reliable andthe people maintain a fragile traditional lifestyle. Comparatively few locals \u2013 mostly men \u2013 speak more than rudimentary Spanish. Sensitivity to the local sentiments of this highly traditional Aymar\u00e1- and Quechua-speaking area will help keep its distinctive character intact.\nEvery town and village in the region \nholds an annual festival, most of which fall between June and September. The  Fiesta de \nLa Virgen de las Nieves , one of the best, takes \nplace in Italaque, northeast of Escoma, around August 5. It features a potpourri of traditional Andean dances.\nCHARAZANI\npop 605 / elevation 3250m\nCharazani is the administrative and com-mercial center and transportation axis of Bautista Saavedra province, and by far the largest town in the area. You can hike from here to the trailhead for the Lagunillas\u2013Agua Blanca trek. Services in Charazani have increased exponentially in recent years, and several NGOs are working in the area on sustainable development projects, including solar power, textile production and the promotion of responsible tourism. It\u2019s a relaxed spot to visit, and weary hikers will enjoy the hot springs.\nTwo fiestas are held in Charazani; the \nbiggest takes place around July 16 and the smaller one around August 6. There\u2019s also a wonderful children\u2019s dance festival (around November 16) in honor of the Virgen del Carmen, an invocation of the Virgin Mary.the right and up to the summit. The summit ridge is very exposed.\nANCOHUMA\nAncohuma is the highest peak in the Sorata Massif, towering on the remote northern edge of the Cordillera Real. It was not climbed until 1919 and remains a challenging climb.\nFor a long time, various sources put \nAncohuma at around 7000m, which would have made it higher than Argentina\u2019s Aconcagua, but in 2002 an American student lugged GPS equipment to the top and determined that its true height is 6427m, a few meters short of Bolivia\u2019s highest mountain, Sajama.\nAccess\nThe peak is accessed via Sorata from where it is possible to rent a 4WD for the long traverse to Cocoyo. More convenient is hiring a 4WD all the way from La Paz to Cocoyo, but it is also considerably more expensive. If you have a serious amount of gear, you can rent a mule train to carry it from Sorata to base camp, which is in the lake basin east of the peaks at about 4500m. Plan on at least two days for these various transportation arrangements to get you to the lakes. Alternatively, Ancohuma can be climbed from the west, using Laguna Glacial  \nas a base camp. Further advice and infor-mation is available in Sorata (p134).\nThe Routes\nFrom the lakes head west up to the glacier following the drainage up through loose moraine. Make camp below the north ridge, the normal route. After a circuitous path through a crevasse field, a steep pitch or two of ice will gain the north ridge. An exposed but fairly easy ridge walk will take you to the summit.\nIf you have opted for the more easily \naccessed western route, hike from Sorata to the base camp at Laguna  Glacial. From \nhere the route climbs the obvious moraine and then ascends the glacier, over fields of extremely dangerous crevasses to a bivouac at 5800m. It then climbs to the bergschrund(crevasse) and across a relatively level ice plateau to the summit pyramid. This is most easily climbed via the north ridge; the first part is quite steep and icy, but then gets easier toward the summit.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4067, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8085821-9428-4e3d-aafd-8ea326773882": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8085821-9428-4e3d-aafd-8ea326773882", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1d17976-e031-4c6b-8eaa-4f611553ee24", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "ef3f591c67675a3d1de1ea247853440efc70c30208c2fb55c77435df135f2da9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3b2fd86-447d-4e99-890e-4899f50f61e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "a4571cd26ac1f4d6890809925b3ac7014b408a192caf02f589b02da1092a83f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Routes\nFrom the lakes head west up to the glacier following the drainage up through loose moraine.

This is most easily climbed via the north ridge; the first part is quite steep and icy, but then gets easier toward the summit.\n13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   14413-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   144 9/12/09   17:21:079/12/09   17:21:07", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3242, "end_char_idx": 4173, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "015747ba-4353-4765-82ec-12294952bfb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "015747ba-4353-4765-82ec-12294952bfb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61f2918b-a944-4626-a672-a4f332fc2ae6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "3710b29c98a1cc0d39c9d5a3b49fc653fffbf9fc7f984ef4ea9b2fc3da6d1bcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE CORDILLERAS  \n& YUNGASlonelyplanet.com CORDILLERA APOLOBAMBA     145\n13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   145 13-the-cordilleras-bol7.indd   145 8/12/09   09:29:31 8/12/09   09:29:31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eccd6456-68f2-45d9-bcb5-bcaec959a73d": {"__data__": {"id_": "eccd6456-68f2-45d9-bcb5-bcaec959a73d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "739506ad-f65c-467d-8abc-1899378018db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "a75970859bab44f20c2d001eef30057eec372224a94a84ea506802b7e4257f01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c453331-5668-4fb4-92f5-4f92caf2e7e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b5b0f748c20a0e9778e6e7005d8991fd1a769b8f53c8ab36304cff6e761f83f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE CORDILLERAS  \n& YUNGAS146   CORDILLERA APOLOBAMBA  \u2022\u2022  \u00c1rea Natural de Manejo Integrado Nacional (Anmin) Apolobamba\nof options, including a four-bed mini-\napartment with a private bathroom and small kitchen. \nResidencial Inti Wasi  \n(r per person B$25)  This place \nis near the Hotel Akhamani and is arranged around a traditional cobbled courtyard that provides a pleasant atmosphere.\nSeveral pensiones around the plaza offer\nsoup, a main course and bad coffee for underB$10.

The track stays mostly above 4000m and includes five high passes. There\u2019s arguably no better scenery in the Andes, and along the way you\u2019re sure to see llamas and alpacas, as well as more elusive Andean wildlife, such as visca-chas, vicu\u00f1as, condors and perhaps even a spectacled bear. (The Wildlife Conservation Society runs a bear research center five hours on foot from Pelechuco, where a couple of bears have been tagged and are occasionally observed.)\nThe trek may be done in either direc-\ntion, as both ends have relatively reliable \u2013 albeit limited \u2013 public transportation links with La Paz. Most people do the route from south to north, but starting in Agua Blanca would mean an additional day of downhill walking and could include a grand finale at Charazani\u2019s hot springs. The trail is pre-Columbian and was built on a stone platform, with some areas still having cobbled paving up to 2m wide.\nIt is strongly recommended that you hire \na guide and pack animals for the trek \u2013 no reliable maps of the region exist. Clients must often carry their own food and stove, and are also often expected to provide meals for their guides, porters and mulet-eers. Bring enough food for a week, prefer-ably from La Paz, as Curva and Pelechuco have only basics at inflated prices.The original park \u2013 a loosely defined \nvicu\u00f1a reserve along the Peruvian border \u2013 \nwas established in 1972, and was upgraded in 1997 in Unesco\u2019s \u2018Man and Biosphere Reserve Program.\u2019 Later that same year the Instituto Nacional de Fomento Lanero (Infol) was created to represent wool pro-ducers and was charged with researching, monitoring and preventing habitat deg-radation of the reserve\u2019s camelids. Infol morphed into the Instituto Boliviano de Tecnolog\u00eda Agropecuaria (IBTA), which focuses more on agricultural development and social services.\nThe modern park is home to several \nthousand alpacas and vicu\u00f1as, and also \nto Bolivia\u2019s densest condor  population. In \naddition to the popular hiking routes, you\u2019ll find excellent wild trekking around Lagos Cololo, Nube, Quello, Kanahuma and Pullo Pullo, all of which enjoy snow-covered backdrops and rich waterbird populations, including flamingoes and several species of Andean geese.\nInformation\nA team of park rangers roams between several far-flung Casas de Guardaparques, which are all linked via radio communica-tion but infrequently staffed during the day-time.

About an hour out of Curva, you\u2019ll go across a stream. Continue uphill along the right bank of the stream. At a cultivated patch about 200m before the valley descending from the right flank of the snowy peak, cross the stream to join a well-defined path entering from your left. If you continue along this path, you\u2019ll reach an excellent flat, streamside campsite. Alternatively, keep following this trail for another 1\u00bd hours to an ideal campsite at Jatunpampa (4200m).\nFrom Jatunpampa, head up the valley \nand across a small plain to the col with a cairn, about two hours along. Known as the Cumbre Tambillo , this 4700m pass offers \nfabulous views of Akamani off to the north-west. One to two hours further along you\u2019ll arrive at a good campsite (4100m) near the Incacancha (aka Incachani) waterfall.\nThe following morning\u2019s zig-zag ascent of \nthe Akamani Sacred Hill  looks a bit daunting, \nbut it isn\u2019t that bad. Cross the bridge below the waterfall and follow the switchbacks up the scree gully. As you ascend, enjoy distant views of Ancohuma and Illampu. After two hours or so you\u2019ll reach Mil Curvas (4800m), \nanother high pass.\nFrom the pass, traverse gently uphill \nto the left until you gain the ridge, which affords great views of the Cordillera Real to the south and Cuchillo II to the north. At this point the obvious trail descends past a small lake before arriving at a larger lake with a good view of Akamani.\nClimb up to the next ridge before des-\ncending an hour to the small mining settlement of Viscachani, where you\u2019ll strike the 4WD track toward Hilo Hilo (aka Illo Illo). In another hour this road ascends to the Cumbre Viscachani  pass (4900m), which \nalso provides superb views of the Cordillera Real to the south and the Sunchulli Valley to the north and west.\nAt the pass the road drops into the \nvalley; at the point where it bears right, look for a path turning off to the left. This will take you to a point above the Sunchulli gold \nmine. From Sunchulli, follow a contour line above the aqueduct for about an hour, until you see an idyllic campsite (4600m) below Cuchillo I.\nThe fourth day of th e hike is probably \nthe finest, as it includes sections that have Access\nTrans Altiplano (% in La Paz 2-238-0859)  runs \ndaily buses to Lagunillas from La Paz.

If you want to start from Charazani, you can either follow the long and winding road for four to five hours or take the 3\u00bd- to four-hour shortcut. Cross the river at the thermal baths, then climb the other bank and head back to the road. After about an hour you should follow a path that climbs to a white-and-yellow church on your left. Beyond the church, descend the other side of the hill, to just above the community of Ni\u00f1ocor\u00edn. After a short dis-tance you\u2019ll strike an obvious path; turn left onto it and follow it as it contours through the fields and then descends to cross a river, where it starts the steep climb into Curva.\nMost people choose to start in Lagu-\nnillas, with its pretty lake bristling with waterbirds. The albergue here (p147) can \narrange beasts of burden and guides. From here, it\u2019s a short walk to the village of Curva , \ncenter of the Kallawaya community.

The correct route is to the right, leav-ing the village above the school between the public facilities and the cemetery. From there, cross the llama pastures until the path becomes clear again. After crossing a bridge (about an hour out of town) and begin-ning up the Palca Valley with a sharp rock peak at its head (if it\u2019s too overcast to see the rock, look for several small houses on your left and turn there), you\u2019ll stumble onto an ideal campsite set in a bend in the valley, where there are a number of large fallen rocks.\nFrom the campsite, head up the valley \nfor about 1\u00bd hours until you reach a bridge over the stream. At this point the route begins  to ascend to the Cumbre Kiayansani  \npass (4900m), which you should reach in another 1\u00bd hours. From the pass, descend past a lake, crossing pastures full of llamas, and follow some pre-Columbian pav-ing as well as stone steps cut into the rock that date from the same period. In less than two hours you\u2019ll arrive in Pelechuco, a been used for centuries by miners and campesinos. From the campsite, the road ascends for about two hours via a series of switchbacks to the Cumbre Sunchulli  (5100m) \npass. From the pas s, you can scramble up \nto a cairn above the road for excellent views dominated by Colocolo (5916m), \nthe southern Cordillera Apolobamba\u2019s highest peak.\nDescend along the road for a few min-\nutes, then jog right down a steep but ob-vious path that crosses a stream opposite the glacier lake below Cuchillo II before descending to the valley floor. If you fol-low the valley floor, you\u2019ll rejoin the road a couple of minutes above the picturesque stone-and-thatch village of Piedra Grande, three hours from the pass. Camping is pos-sible here.\nFollow the road for about an hour, then \njoin the pre-Hispanic road turning off downhill to your right. After you cross a bridge, you should follow the obvious path to the right, leading you up into the village of Hilo Hilo in about an hour. Here you\u2019ll find \nsmall stores selling the basics and it may even be possible to rent a room for the night.\nTHE KALLAWAYA\nOriginating in six villages around Curva in the Apolobamba region, the Kallawaya are a group of \nhealers who pass ancient traditions down the generations, usually from father to son. Around a quarter of the inhabitants of these villages become involved in the healing tradition, although there are many more people throughout the Andes that pass themselves off as authentic Kallawaya when they are nothing of the kind.\nThe origins and age of the Kallawaya tradition are unknown, although some Kallawaya claim \nto be descended from the vanished people of Tiwanaku. The Kallawaya language, however, which is used exclusively for healing, is derived from Quechua, the language of the Incas. Knowledge and skills are passed down through generations, although it\u2019s sometimes possible for aspiring healers to study under acknowledged masters.\nThe early Kallawaya were known for their wanderings and traveled all over the continent in \nsearch of medicinal herbs. The most capable of today\u2019s practitioners will have memorized the properties and uses of 600 to 1000 different healing herbs, but their practices also involve magic and charms. They believe that sickness and disease are the result of a displaced or imbalanced ajallu (life force). The incantations and amulets are intended to encourage it back into a state of equilibrium within the body.\nA hallmark of the Kallawaya is the alforja (medicine pouch) which is carried by the men. While \nwomen don\u2019t become healers, they still play an important part in the gathering of herbs.\nIn Lagunillas, there\u2019s a small exhibition about the Kallawaya in the Museo Interpretativo \nCenter.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3962, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a794333-6fd1-4f43-9118-8f33bded2341": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a794333-6fd1-4f43-9118-8f33bded2341", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "40e97ae6-a9d7-4ee8-97b7-819889abf83f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "8f667174c2e53ec85a96b71c92f3b85d1742a6c543e0fe30e21c0817b9008ed1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed11d532-aa16-4f2e-8553-b3cce6acf1e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "8e84f5e126ce3f259452a33f61ea3ca413ddcbae9e466d2455f788dce7f19d41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The early Kallawaya were known for their wanderings and traveled all over the continent in \nsearch of medicinal herbs.

Although all of the nevados of the Quimsa Cruz have \nnow been climbed, there are still plenty of \nunclimbed routes, and expeditions are likely to have the mountains to themselves. If you have no previous climbing experience you should take a guide from a La Paz agency (p75) who really knows the area.\nTrekking is also possible throughout the \nrange, which is covered by IGM mapping \n(p63). The main route is the two- to three-day Mina Viloco to Mina Caracoles trek , which \ncrosses the range from west to east. Of in-terest along this route is the renowned site of a 1971 airplane crash, which had already been stripped by local miners before rescue teams arrived at the scene two days later! Mina Viloco is 70km southeast of La Paz, and is centered on what was once quite a major tin mine. Mina Caracoles is still worked by cooperatives, and is 13km north-west of Quime.\nStaples are available in both Mina Viloco \nand Quime, but it\u2019s still best to carry everything you\u2019ll need (food, fuel and other supplies) from La Paz.\nGETTING THERE & AWAY\nRoad access is relatively easy because of the number of mines in the area, and it\u2019s pos-sible to drive to within 30 minutes\u2019 walk of some glaciers. Others, however, are up to a four-hour hike from the nearest road.

At night, the starscapes are spectacular, \nand worth enduring the bitter after-dark temperatures for. It can get seriously cold here; the altitude combined with scouring winds and lack of shelter or vegetation can sometimes make traveling here something of an endurance test.\nThe region has traditionally lived off mining, backed up by agriculture (corn, potatoes, \nquinoa) and llama herding. Oruro is a mining city par excellence: gritty, honest and straight-talking, where meat, carbohydrates and hard work rule the day. It\u2019s well worth a visit, especially during Carnaval, but many travelers only pass through, heading with bated breath for Uyuni and the surreal landscapes of the southwest. This is the domain of the 4WD, in which people head out on multiday adventures into the rugged remote terrain.\nSoutheast of Uyuni is Tupiza, where the jagged cactus-studded scenery evokes memories \nof Sergio Leone films and lone gunslingers on fading horses. It\u2019s a great place to jump in the saddle yourself. The western associations are further enhanced by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, whose last stand took place in the remote village of San Vicente.SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO\n14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   15114-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   151 8/12/09   09:25:548/12/09   09:25:54\u00a9 Lonely Planet", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2462, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c8f403e-d8bd-4ead-99fb-d99b0e11060c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c8f403e-d8bd-4ead-99fb-d99b0e11060c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10d1e6e4-8438-4374-9b1c-68bc5829012d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "e4b305159cb78c8303deadccba416da3cf3ab14e5374d0af71f25949e7f529ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com 152    SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO  SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO\n14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   152 14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   152 8/12/09   09:25:54 8/12/09   09:25:54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 176, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35bad01d-3a65-4ca3-a6df-d54eb996cfaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "35bad01d-3a65-4ca3-a6df-d54eb996cfaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd5fea79-359a-489e-8da7-0a11262b2bb8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "f6e24eea6ba80bb6d7f8f7b85f261fe787dd2f97be0237d43b4e09f529f4909d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fd63337-d51b-429a-8c16-cc630232e4c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5404721a59ca9f7740dbd5fdedc97a6c7fb4dbc2f38a8ade79e149a05cb29c09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.com SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO  \u2022\u2022  Oruro   153\nGetting There & Away\nFrom La Paz, the Southern Altiplano is eas-\nily accessed by bus, although off the paved main roads it can be a long and bumpy ride. The route from the central highland cities of Potos\u00ed and Sucre is rough on the back, bum and bladder. The overland route from Chile is a scenic mountain traverse on a good road from Arica, and Villaz\u00f3n has an easy border crossing with Argentina.\nThe train between Oruro and Villaz\u00f3n, \nwhich stops in Uyuni and Tupiza, provides a fine overland alternative to grueling bus travel. \nORURO\npop 260,000 / elevation 3706m\nBy far the largest settlement of the Southern Altiplano, palindromic Oruro is a miners\u2019 city with a tough climate. In many ways it\u2019s the most Bolivian of Bolivia\u2019s nine pro-vincial capitals, an intriguing place where 90% of the inhabitants are of pure indig-enous heritage. Locals refer to themselves as quirquinchos  (armadillos), after the \ncarapaces used in their charangos  (tradi-\ntional Bolivian ukulele-type instruments). Orure\u00f1os are salty, hard-working and up-\nfront people who have had it tough over the years with the decline of Bolivian mining and the extreme climate.\nOruro, whose name means \u2018where the \nsun is born,\u2019 sits against a range of mineral-rich low hills at the northern end of the salty Lakes Uru Uru and Poop\u00f3, linked by river to Titicaca. While many visitors slate Oruro, it\u2019s got decent museums and restaurants, and there\u2019s plenty to see in the surrounding area. It\u2019s also culturally very colorful, with a rich dance and musical heritage that culmi-nates in the riotous Carnaval celebrations, famous throughout South America for the lavish costumes and elaborate traditions on display. \nHistory\nFounded in the early 17th century, Oruro owes its existence to the mineral-rich 10-sq-km range of hills rising 350m behind the city. Chock-full of copper, silver and tin, these hills still form the city\u2019s economic backbone.\nBy the 1920s Bolivia\u2019s thriving tin-\nmining industry rested in the hands of three powerful capitalists. The most renowned History\nThe prehistoric Lakes Minch\u00edn and Tauca, which once covered most of this high-land plateau, evaporated around 10,000 years ago, leaving behind a parched land-scape of brackish puddles and salt deserts. Humans haven\u2019t left much of a mark on the region; some time in the mid-15th century, the Inca ruler sent his son Tupac Inca Yupanqui southward to conquer all the lands he encountered. Yupanqui and his gang marched on across the wastelands to the northern bank of Chile\u2019s R\u00edo Maule, where a fierce band of Araucanian people inspired them to stake out the southern boundary of the Inca empire and turn back toward Cuzco.\nThese days, outside the major towns and \ncities, most of the people cluster around mining camps. Mining has been fundamen-tal to most of the area, and although many of the major operations closed down in the crisis period of Bolivian mining during the late \u201980s, miners continue to operate on a local cooperative basis.\n   \nClimate\nClimatically, the best months to visit are August, September and October, after the worst of the winter chills and before the summer rains. From May to early July, nighttime temperatures combined with stiff winds can lower the wind-chill temperature to -40.5\u00b0C. Summer is warmer but, for an arid area, there\u2019s quite a lot of rainfall be-tween November and March.

The Reserva Nacional de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa (p173) is a highlight of Southwest Circuit tours and the gateway to Chile for those headed for the desert oasis of San Pedro de Atacama.SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO\n14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   153 14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   153 8/12/09   09:25:54 8/12/09   09:25:54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3191, "end_char_idx": 4223, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0653e255-d98e-472f-a287-c57e95c45208": {"__data__": {"id_": "0653e255-d98e-472f-a287-c57e95c45208", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a1f821b-5d7d-4c80-96ce-aec39a92027e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "be9cb38e8f77137333aa07c8adce78c111bcd67a8fe200ae54f568e152bb4e66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SOUTHERN ALTIPLANOlonelyplanet.com 154    SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO  \u2022\u2022  Oruro\n14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   154 14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   154 8/12/09   09:25:55 8/12/09   09:25:55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 185, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e10730c-c335-4797-a3eb-3576ccc6f37c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e10730c-c335-4797-a3eb-3576ccc6f37c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ee915be-a1de-44a5-9f60-0bca202ac698", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "d9f25c8d5c38ecc9bccf119513d63bd258ce205e807f60ff2dffa3ef64fc302b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "beed7102-83cd-4a91-9cb3-d501084a4562", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83774155528f470a30ea35319d4ff2ee3a34f2b32f504ddb5869d2035f577672", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SOUTHERN ALTIPLANOlonelyplanet.com SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO  \u2022\u2022  Oruro   155\nwas Sim\u00f3n Pati\u00f1o, a mestizo from the \nCochabamba valley who became one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men. In 1897 Pati\u00f1o pur-chased La Salvadora mine near the village of Uncia, east of Oruro, which eventually became the world\u2019s most productive tin source. Pati\u00f1o\u2019s fortunes snowballed and by 1924 he had gained control of about 50% of the nation\u2019s tin output.\nOnce secure in his wealth, Pati\u00f1o emi-\ngrated from Bolivia to Britain, where he started buying up European and North American smelters and tin interests. As a consequence, Bolivia found itself exporting both its precious metal and its profits. Pub-lic outcry launched a series of labor upris-ings, and set the stage for nationalization of the mines in 1952 and the subsequent crea-tion of the government-run Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia (Comibol).\nDecades of government inefficiency, cor-\nruption and low world tin prices preceded the push for capitalizaci\u00f3n  (a variation on \nprivatization), which eventually brought about the dissolution of Comibol in the mid-1980s. When the last mine had closed in Oruro, it was a hard hit for the city. \nThe price of tin went up yet again in the \nearly 1990s and a handful of local coopera-tive mines reopened. Until 2008, tin cost US$19 per pound on the global market and the average monthly salary of a miner was US$3000. In 2008, the price of tin dropped to US$7 per pound, salaries plummeted to US$280, several mines closed down and 1500 miners were out of work. Things have slowly started to look up since, as the Morales government is now seeking investment to reopen some of the mines.\nOrure\u00f1os  are extremely proud that Morales \nis from their province; he was born in Isallavi, a tiny Aymar\u00e1 village on the western side of Lake Poop\u00f3, and went to secondary school in Oruro.\nInformation\nEMERGENCY\nTourist police (% 528-7774) Round-the-clock \noperation at the bus terminal; shares the kiosk with the tourist info point and gives out maps. \nIMMIGRATION\nMigraci\u00f3n  (% 527-0239; S Galvarro, btwn Ayacucho & \nCochabamba; h 8:30am-12:30pm & 2:30-6:30pm Mon-\nFri) Extend your stay here (last door on the left).

It\u2019s a great \ntime to visit, when this somewhat unfashionable mining city becomes the focus of the nation\u2019s attention. In a broad sense, these festivities can be described as re-enactments of the triumph of good over evil, but the festival is so interlaced with threads of both Christian and indigenous myths, fables, deities and traditions that it would be inaccurate to oversimplify it in this way.\nThe origins of a similar festival may be traced back to the medieval kingdom of Arag\u00f3n, these \ndays part of Spain, although orure\u00f1os  (Oruro locals) maintain that it commemorates an event \nthat occurred during the early days of their own fair city. Legend has it that one night a thief called Chiruchiru was seriously wounded by a traveler he\u2019d attempted to rob. Taking pity on the wrongdoer, the Virgin of Candelaria gently helped him reach his home near the mine at the base of Cerro Pi\u00e9 del Gallo and succored him until he died. When the miners found him there, an image of the Virgin hung over his head. Today, the mine is known as the Socav\u00f3n de la Virgen (Grotto of the Virgin), and a large church, the Santuario de la Virgen del Socav\u00f3n (opposite), has been built over it to house the Virgin. The Virgen del Socav\u00f3n, as she is also now known, is the city\u2019s patron. This legend has been combined with the ancient Uru tale of Huari and the struggle of Archangel Michael (San Miguel) against the seven deadly sins into the spectacle that is presented during the Oruro Carnaval.\nCeremonies begin several weeks before Carnaval itself, with a solemn pledge of loyalty to the \nVirgin in the sanctuary. From this date on, there are various candlelit processions, and dance groups practice boisterously in the city\u2019s streets.\nAs well as traditional Bolivian dance groups, such as the Caporales, Llameradas, Morenadas \nand Tinkus, Oruro\u2019s Carnaval features La Diablada  (Dance of the Devils). These demonic dancers \nare dressed in extravagant garb. The design and creation of Diablada costumes has become an art form in Oruro, and several Diablada clubs \u2013 consisting of members from all levels of Oruro society \u2013 are sponsored by local businesses. There are anywhere between 40 and 300 dancing participants, whose costumes may cost several hundred dollars each.\nThe main event kicks off on the Saturday before Ash Wednesday with the spectacular entrada  \n(entrance procession) led by the brightly costumed San Miguel character. Behind him, dancing and marching, come the famous devils and a host of bears and condors. The chief devil Lucifer wears the most extravagant costume, complete with a velvet cape and an ornate mask. Faith-fully at his side are two other devils, including Supay, an Andean god of evil that inhabits the hills and mineshafts. The procession is followed by other dance groups, vehicles adorned with jewels, coins and silverware (in commemoration of the achura  rites in which the Inca offered their \ntreasures to Inti (the sun) in the festival of Inti Raymi), and the miners offer the year\u2019s highest-quality mineral to El T\u00edo, the demonic character who is owner of all underground minerals and precious metals. Behind them follow Inca characters and a group of conquistadores, including Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. \nWhen the archangel and the devils arrive at the soccer stadium, they engage in a series of dances \nthat tell the story of the ultimate battle between good and evil. After it becomes apparent that good has triumphed over evil, the dancers retire to the Santuario de la Virgen del Socav\u00f3n at dawn on the Sunday, and a mass is held in honor of the Virgin, who pronounces that good has prevailed.\nThere\u2019s another, less spectacular entrada  on the Sunday afternoon, and more dance displays \non the Monday. The next day, Shrove Tuesday, is marked by family reunions and cha\u2019lla  libations, \nin which alcohol is sprinkled over worldly goods to invoke a blessing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4084, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "accf4d24-bd73-44c5-89de-7685aab94085": {"__data__": {"id_": "accf4d24-bd73-44c5-89de-7685aab94085", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d85514a7-214a-4449-ab8b-e0f52da63d6b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "19c62be889ef09fee8df673f840a96158afba9663e24e3dc0fb580d3a65e2345", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f25ecd4-1127-4a89-927e-f13c3493dbc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "f11cedeede6ebef1911d87fa9e65e90f7432ae4f2eab9f203ecfba6a51ae4729", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Behind them follow Inca characters and a group of conquistadores, including Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. \nWhen the archangel and the devils arrive at the soccer stadium, they engage in a series of dances \nthat tell the story of the ultimate battle between good and evil.

He charges by the kilometer (B$3.20) plus his guide services (B$267 per day). His tours are reportedly very safe, more personalized and generally of higher quality. \nSleeping\nAccommodations are often booked solid during Carnaval, when there\u2019s also a three-night minimum stay. It\u2019s wise to reserve ahead of time or ask the tourist office about \nrooms in local homes. Expect to pay up to five or six times the normal price for a room.\nThere are good lodging options by the \nbus station and less appealing ones by the train station, but by far the most interest-ing place to be is in the centre.

The present church, which is a 19th-cen-tury reconstruction of the 1781 original, figures prominently in Oruro\u2019s Carnaval as the site where good ultimately defeats evil (see boxed text, p157).\nCapilla de Serrato , a steep climb from the \nend of Calle Washington, offers impressive city views.

Oruro province is particularly rich in chullpas,  especially along the shores of \nLago Poop\u00f3 and around the Sajama area. A chullpa  was constructed of stone or adobe, \nand typically had a beehive-shaped open-ing, which nearly always faced east towards the rising sun. The body was placed in the fetal position along with various posses-sions. Some communities would ritually open the chullpas  on feast days and make \nofferings to the mummified ancestors; the Chipaya (see boxed text, p179) still do. Most of the tombs, however, have been looted, apart from some bones here and there, and the mummies can now be found in museums, such as the Museo Antropo-l\u00f3gico Eduardo L\u00f3pez Rivas in Oruro (p156). The biggest concentration is found along the road from Patacamaya to Chile. There are also between 18 and 25 chullpas  along \nthe Lauca circuit (see p165). \n14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   162 14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   162 8/12/09   09:25:56 8/12/09   09:25:56", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2330, "end_char_idx": 4360, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45af6f43-cbc9-4735-9a08-ba1e6b1d8f74": {"__data__": {"id_": "45af6f43-cbc9-4735-9a08-ba1e6b1d8f74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db6f017c-b002-46bb-a2fb-f1dbe90df658", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "27286c38cf74d7c58773389030f3f94d4e09da50529165861a5c2bcbc4c42b44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "191af788-b790-4e4b-ac45-05703ff6c089", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "694b239a3b63ff95a3185cae8ad8f42b96c9a5c8f488e1dc50dee3877d8407fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SOUTHERN ALTIPLANOlonelyplanet.com SOUTHERN ALTIPLANO  \u2022\u2022  Parque Nacional Sajama   163\npeak.

It was created on November 5, 1945 for the pro-tection of the rare wildlife that inhabits this northern extension of the Atacama Desert. Unfortunately, depredation has already eliminated several species, and only limited numbers of vicu\u00f1a (whose wool is very prized, at US$500 per kilo), condor, flamingo, rhea and armadillo survive.\nThe world\u2019s highest forest covers the \nfoothills flanking the awe-inspiring Volc\u00e1n \nSajama , which at 6542m is Bolivia\u2019s highest ANDEAN CAMELIDS\nUnlike the Old World, the western hemisphere had few grazing mammals after the Pleistocene \nera, when mammoths, horses and other large herbivores disappeared from North and South America. For millennia, the Andean people relied on the New World camelids \u2013 the wild guanaco and vicu\u00f1a and the domesticated llama and alpaca \u2013 for food and fiber.\nGuanaco (Lama guanicoe)  and vicu\u00f1a (Vicugna vicugna)  are relatively rare today but are the likely \nancestors of the domesticated llama (L glama)  and alpaca (Vicugna pacos) . In fact they were among \nfew potential New World domestic animals \u2013 contrast them with the Old World cattle, horses, sheep, goats, donkeys and pigs that have filled so many vacant niches in the Americas. While the New World camels have lost ground to sheep and cattle in some areas, they are not likely to disappear.\nThe rust-colored guanaco ranges from sea level up to 4000m or higher. There\u2019s only a small \npopulation in Bolivia; the animals can be seen in the highland plains of the Reserva Nacional de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa (p173).\nThe vicu\u00f1a occupies a much smaller zone, well above 4000m in the highlands from \nsouthern Peru to northwestern Argentina. Although not as numerous as the guanaco, it played  a critical role in the cultural life of pre-Columbian Peru. Its very fine golden wool was the exclusive property of the Inca emperors.\nStrict Inca authority protected the vicu\u00f1a, but the Spanish invasion destroyed that authority. \nBy the middle of last century, poaching reduced vicu\u00f1a numbers from two million to perhaps 10,000 and caused it to become endangered. Conservation efforts in Chile\u2019s Parque Nacional Lauca and Bolivia\u2019s Parque Nacional Apolobamba have been so successful that economic exploitation of the species is now being allowed in some communities.\nThe Altiplano\u2019s indigenous communities still depend on llamas and alpacas for their livelihood. \nThe two species appear very similar but they differ in several important respects.

If \nthere\u2019s nobody at the church, look for the key in the Entel shop.\nLocated near Parque Nacional Sajama, \na new tourist circuit called Lauca  is slowly \nattracting visitors. It\u2019s organized between three communities \u2013 Macaya, Julo and Sacabaya \u2013 that are trying to promote the area and boost their income. Highlights include several lagoons with flamingos and about 25 painted chullpas  erected between \n1470 and 1540. The area is difficult to visit independently so your best bet is going with one of the agencies in La Paz, such as Bolivia Milenaria (see p351); the tour can be done in about four hours from Sajama National Park and costs B$425, with jeep transportation, entrance fee and lunch. You can ask to be dropped off in Tambo Quemado, if continuing on to Chile. \nSOUTHWESTERN \nBOLIVIA\nThe southwest of Bolivia is perhaps its most \nmagical corner, a wilderness of harsh hill-scapes, bubbling geysers and psychedelic mineral colors. Although it gets plenty of visitors, in many ways it\u2019s still a remote wilderness, with rough dirt roads, scattered mining settlements, quinoa-producing villages and little public transportation.\nThe main town, Uyuni, is a military out-\npost with a real frontier feel; at times you expect the harsh temperatures and biting winds to do away with it altogether. It\u2019s Sleeping & Eating\nCamping is fine just about anywhere in this sparsely populated region, so a tent and a good cold-weather sleeping bag are rec-ommended.

Try to book a room at Hostal Sajama, the best of the homestays, where each room comes with a private bathroom.

Many tours visit the train cem-etery as a first or last stop on the three-day salar  circuit.\nYou can hire bikes in Uyuni to explore \nthe town itself at the makeshift bike rental \nkiosk  \n(per 3hr B$25; h closed Sun)  opposite the \npost office.\nThe big market day in Uyuni is Thursday \nwhen Potos\u00ed gets taken over by stalls selling anything from arts and crafts to television sets; Sunday is a smaller market day.\nTours\nWhile you can theoretically visit the Salar de Uyuni and the attractions of the South-west Circuit independently, it is extremely challenging due to unreliable transport and the remoteness of th e area. So the vast \nmajority of people take an organized tour from either Uyuni or Tupiza (p182).\nThe most popular tour is the three-\nday circuit taking in the Salar de Uyuni, Laguna Colorada, Sol de Ma\u00f1ana, Laguna Verde and points in between. Check with the agency about reversing the standard circuit, that way, you will arrive at the salar  \nearly in the morning on the third day, when the lighting is at its best. Expect to pay between B$600 and B$850 for this trip, with six people in the jeep. The main advantages are that the circuit takes in many stunning natural sights and that, because it is so popular, you\u2019ll have little trouble finding Information\nIMMIGRATION\nMigraci\u00f3n  (Ferroviaria btwn Arce & Sucre; h 8:30am-\nnoon & 2:30-6pm Mon-Fri, 8:30am-noon Sat & Sun) Exit stamps cost B$21.\nINTERNET ACCESS\nThere are several internet places in town \nbut most have painfully slow dial-up con-nections; an hour costs between B$4 and B$5.

There \nhave been reports of travelers\u2019 vegetarian requests not being heard so make sure you get that in writing. It\u2019s always better to sign up with an agency that has a cook onboard, otherwise the driver will double as the cook, which isn\u2019t an appealing prospect.\nCHOOSING THE SOUTHWEST CIRCUIT \nAGENCY\nYour choice of tour operator is an impor-\ntant one; a well-run trip might well be a highlight of your traveling life, while a surly salar  disaster could wreck your trip. Uyuni \nis a far-flung outpost, and tourism is what keeps it viable these days, so it\u2019s little won-der that everyone wants a piece of the pie. A mushrooming number of agencies \u2013 nearly 80 at last count \u2013 offer salar  tours. While this \nmeans you have more choice, the flipside is that there are many dubious operators who have neither the best interests of their customers nor the environment at heart.\nSome of the agencies are \u2018pirate\u2019 opera-\ntions, meaning they hire private jeep owners without any insurance and with poorly kept vehicles, just to make a few bucks. Some agencies are even involved in smuggling cocaine into Chile. Worst of all, there have been a few deadly accidents in the salar in \nthe last couple of years, due to often drunk or reckless drivers. So do think twice before trying to bargain down the price and going with the cheapest agency on the block.\nThe typical tour is in a 4WD of variable \nhealth holding up to six passengers, a cook (with some agencies) and a driver/guide who may or may not speak English. Some agencies will try to squeeze in the seventh passenger into the jeep but this is inadvis-able for comfort and safety reasons. Also, try to find out who else signed up for the tour; there have been reports of solo travel-ers being put with a group of people who don\u2019t even speak their language, which can turn into a very lonely trip.\nEspecially significant is the condition of \nthe vehicle. The salar  is super-tough on cars, \nso maintenance is crucial. That said, even the most reliable companies have frequent breakdowns; how they deal with them (and you) is the crux of the matter.companions to make up the numbers on a tour. The disadvantage is that it is very much a \u2018trail\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual to see a couple of dozen 4WDs parked up alongside some of the major attractions. \nIf you have the time and cash, opt for \nthe four-day circuit which is a lot more rewarding. These cost between B$800 and B$1000, and many end up in Tupiza. Possible activities include climbing volca-noes and visiting some off-the-beaten path attractions (p177).\nAnother option offered by a variety of \nagencies is to do the three-day circuit and then connect at Laguna Verde with an on-ward transfer to the pretty town of San Pedro de Atacama in northeast Chile. This is now a popular means of crossing between Bolivia and Chile. When booking, check that the price of the transfer to San Pedro is included.\nShorter visits, basically taking in just the \nsalar,  cost from B$200 to B$400 for two \ndays and one night. Single-day trips also run (B$150 to B$230), but these have an-gered the locals around the salar,  who feel \nthat their community gains nothing from these visits. \nNote that during the rainy season, between \nJanuary and March, some agencies shut down. Those that do operate offer cheaper tours and tend to be more open to nego-tiation. Ensure the vehicle and driver are reliable, as entering the salar during the \nrains can be downright dangerous.\nWith the increasing number of people on \nthe standard trail, and a growing number of interesting choices of accommodations around the Salar de Uyuni and South-west Circuit, it\u2019s an appealing prospect to customize your own tour, striking off into lesser-known areas, or incorporat-ing some climbing or walking opportuni-ties.

The best of the bunch fill up fast in the high season Of course, an important criterion for \nmany travelers is price. But, while it\u2019s often possible to negotiate a cheaper rate, you\u2019re often only cutting off your own options. Due to the competition, the agencies make a very small profit on these tours. So if you manage to chop B$100 off the price, think about where it\u2019ll be made up \u2013 a seventh person squeezed in next to you perhaps, part of the circuit skipped, or, much sim-pler, by serving smaller meals. Think care-fully about whether you want to wreck a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the sake of a few dollars. The cheapest operators also tend to be those with least knowledge of, and respect for, the unique environment of the southwest. \nTrips are cheaper if you form a group of \nfour to six.

From there, you can make your way to Tarija. The road to Potos\u00ed was being paved at the time of research and should be up and running by the time you read this, reducing travel time by about an hour.\nThere are daily bus services to Tupiza \n(B$60, seven to eight hours), leaving around 6am. The same buses continue on to Villaz\u00f3n (B$80, 10 hours), which is the way to go if you\u2019re continuing on to Salta, as there are regular buses from there.\nThere are buses at 3:30am on Monday \nand Thursday and at 5am on Sunday and Wednesday to Calama (B$100, nine hours) in Chile. You will have to change buses in Avaroa at the Chilean border; there are sometimes waits of up to two hours.\nAn alternative route to Chile is with an \norganized tour, which will leave you in San Pedro de Atacama. Some of the tour com-panies, including Estrella del Sur (p169\n) \nand Cordillera (p169 ), both with offices \nin Chile, offer direct jeep transfers to San Pedro, which cost around B$280 per person. The jeeps typically leave at 4pm, there\u2019s a sleepover in Villa Mar, and you arrive in San Pedro at noon the next day. From San Pedro, buses to Salta depart three times weekly (Tuesday, Friday and Saturday) at 10:30am. \nTRAIN\nUyuni has a modern, well-organized train \nstation (% 693-2320) .

Buy your bus ticket the day before and your train ticket as far in advance as you can. An airstrip is currently being built by the military air force with money from Venezuela. There\u2019s talk of commercial flights with TAM starting up once it\u2019s done (rumor has it by the end of 2010).\nIf you\u2019re heading on to Chile, it can be a \nwise idea to pick up a Bolivian exit stamp at Migraci\u00f3n (p167), since the hours of the Bolivian border post at Hito Caj\u00f3n (just beyond Laguna Verde) are somewhat unre-liable.

Here, blocks of salt are cut from the salar  and made into furniture and \nlively works of art. Colchani is also home to several salt hotels (see boxed text, p174). Some salt workers living in Uyuni commute daily to Colchani in private vehicles or on motorcycles; if you wait at the gas station just outside of town, you may be able to hitch along for a small fee. Otherwise, a return taxi ride will cost around B$200, with a little extra for any wait time.\nTHE SOUTHWEST \nCIRCUIT\nBolivia\u2019s southwestern corner is an awe-\ninspiring collection of harsh, diverse land-scapes ranging from the blinding white Salar de Uyuni salt flat to the geothermal hotbed of Los L\u00edpez, one of the world\u2019s harsh-est wilderness regions and an important refuge for many Andean wildlife species. The ground here literally boils with minerals, and the spectrum of colors is extraordinary. A circuit from Uyuni takes you through absolutely unforgettable, literally breath-taking landscapes and is the highlight of many people\u2019s visit to Bolivia.\nMuch of the region is nominally pro-\ntected in the Reserva Nacional de Fauna Andina \nEduardo Avaroa\n (REA; www.bolivia-rea.com; admission \nB$30) , which was created in 1973, covers an \narea of 7150 sq km and receives in excess of 50,000 visitors annually. Its emphasis is on preserving the vicu\u00f1a and the yareta  \nplant, both of which are threatened in Bo-livia, as well as other unique ecosystems and endemic species. (Note: there is talk of a steep admission hike.)\nMost people visit the region on an or-\nganized trip from Uyuni (p167) or Tupiza (p182); see the boxed text, p178 for some alternative things to do. This section is organized to highlight the attractions of the standard three-day circuit, as well as some lesser-visited sights typically visited only on longer tours.\nApart from a couple of Entel points, there \nare no phones out in the Southwest Circuit. All communication is by radio. Any phone numbers listed in this section are for offices Depending on size, you may have to \ncheck your backpack/case into the luggage compartment. Look out for snatch thieves on the train just before it pulls out.\nOn Monday at 3:30am a train trundles \nwest for Avaroa (B$32, five hours) on the Chilean border, where you cross to Ollag\u00fce and may have to wait a few hours to clear Chilean customs. From here, another train continues to Calama (B$91 from Uyuni, six hours from Ollag\u00fce). The whole trip can take up to 24 hours but it\u2019s a spectacular, if uncomfortable journey. Taking a bus to Calama is more reliable.\nAROUND UYUNI\nAt the semi-ghost town of Pulacayo , 22km \nnortheast of Uyuni, brilliantly colored rocks rise beside the road and a mineral-rich stream reveals streaks of blue, yellow, red and green. The Pulacayo mines  north of \nthe village, which yielded mainly silver, were first opened in the late 17th century; today, only a few hundred hardy souls remain. There are several kilometers of mine tunnels to explore, if you find a local \nguide. Also worthwhile is the mill that spins \nllama wool into cloth, and the mansion  of \nthe 22nd president of Bolivia, Aniceto Arce Ru\u00edz. Pulacayo is also home to several de-caying steam locomotives  that were originally \nimported to transport ore.

A bus departs daily at noon (B$5) outside the post office in Uyuni; you can return with one of the buses coming into Uyuni from Potos\u00ed.\nRight on the edge of the Salar de Uyuni, \nColchani , 20km north of Uyuni, is the easi-\nest point to access that great salt flat, and the place to go if you just want a glimpse of it without going on a tour. There remain at least 10 billion tons of salt in the Salar de Uyuni, and around Colchani campesinos  (subsistence farmers) hack it \nout with picks and shovels and pile it into small conical mounds that characterize the salar  landscape. Most of the salt is sold to \nrefiners and hauled off by rail, but some is exchanged with local villages for wool, meat and grease. Most tour groups stop at the small museum  \n(admission B$5) dealing with \nthe salar and the salt trade. Apart from \nthe handful of salt sculptures, it\u2019s more of a souvenir stop selling ponchos, hats, gloves and sweaters.

These are unique and comfortable places to stay, where nearly everything is constructed of blocks of salt (with a few obvious exceptions). Note that it is illegal to actually construct buildings on the salar  itself \u2013 Playa Blanca salt hotel, a morning stop \non many tours, falls into this category due to its sewage system polluting the salt pan. Local environmentalists strongly recommend that you don\u2019t give them any business so try to boycott if you can, even if the driver stops the jeep there. \nRight on the edge of the salt, the Hotel Palacio de Sal  \n(%622-9512 ; www.palaciodesal.com; \ns/d B$1190/1400; s ) is a luxurious complex built almost completely out of the white condiment, \nthe first such hotel opened in the region. It boasts all sorts of facilities ranging from a pool and sauna to a salt golf course (don\u2019t bring your favorite white balls). Breakfast and dinner are included in the rates. The hotel is booked through Hidalgo Tours (p235) in Potos\u00ed or at the Jardines de Uyuni hotel (p171); it comes cheaper as part of a package. \nAnother salty option is Luna Salada Hotel (\n% 278-5438; www.lunasaladahotel.com.bo; s/d B$605/780 ), \nan award-winning place, 7km from Colchani, with 23 stylish rooms and a panoramic restaurant.\nAt the time of writing, there were three hotels being constructed on the edge of salt, about \n4km from Colchani, and more around the other edges of the salar  where most agencies spend \nthe first night of the three-day tour. These are typically small, private affairs in local villages such as Quimisa and Candelaria.\nAt the village of Coquesa,  under the Tunupa volcano, there is a cozy salt hostel called Maya  \n(\nr per person B$35 ) run by a local Aymar\u00e1 family. The beds are built on salt blocks, the doors and \nwindows of cactus wood, and the dining room has salt tables with a splendid view over the salar .

This hilly outpost is covered in Trichoreus cactus and surrounded by a flat white sea of hexagonal salt tiles.

There\u2019s a B$21 exit tax.\nOTHER SOUTHWEST ATTRACTIONS \nSome of the tour agencies are increasingly offering alternative tours of the Southwest Circuit. These customized trips are usually pricier than typical three-day jaunts but in-volve visits to some less-visited attractions in Los L\u00edpez and a real sense of discovery. This region is a land of bizarre lava forma-tions, active volcanoes, abandoned villages, badlands, salt flats, pre-Incan cave cem-eteries, lone quinoa fields, flying condors, multicolored lagoons and sulfur lakes. We\u2019ve listed some of the places where you won\u2019t be surrounded by packs of jeeps and other travelers, where the feel of the last frontier is true and real.\nIsla C\u00e1scara de Huevo\nThe small Eggshell Island  was named for the \nbroken shells of birds\u2019 eggs that litter it. It lies near the southern end of the Salar de Uyuni and is visited mainly to see the strange patterns of salt crystallization in the area, some of which resemble roses.corner of Bolivian territory, 52km south of Sol de Ma\u00f1ana. The incredible green color comes from high concentrations of lead, sulfur, arsenic and calcium carbonates. In this exposed position, an icy wind blows almost incessantly, whipping the water into a brilliant green-and-white froth. This surface agitation, combined with the high mineral content, means that it can remain liquid at temperatures as low as -21.2\u00b0C. \nBehind the lake rises the cone of Volc\u00e1n \nLicancabur (5960m), whose summit is said \nto have once sheltered an ancient Inca crypt. Some tours include an ascent of Licancabur (see boxed text, p178), and although it presents no technical difficul-ties, the wind, temperature, altitude and ball-bearing volcanic pumice underfoot make it quite grueling. \nWhere the route splits about 20km south \nof Sol de Ma\u00f1ana, the more scenic left fork climbs up and over a 5000m pass, then up a stark hillside resembling a freshly raked Zen garden dotted with the enormous Rocas de Dal\u00ed , which appear to have been \nmeticulously placed by the surrealist master Salvador himself.\nGETTING THERE & AWAY\nMost agencies now offer cross-border connections to San Pedro de Atacama by arrangement with Chilean operators. It\u2019s \nFROZEN FLAMINGOS\nThree species of flamingo breed in the bleak high country of southwestern Bolivia, and once \nyou\u2019ve seen these posers strutting through icy mineral lagoons at 5000m elevation, you\u2019ll abandon time-worn associations between flamingos, coconut palms and the steamy tropics. The sight of these pinky-white birds with their black bills and tails adds yet another color to the already spectacular palette hereabouts.\nFlamingos have a complicated and sophisticated system for filtering the foodstuffs from highly \nalkaline brackish lakes. They filter algae and diatoms from the water by sucking in and vigor-ously expelling water from the bill several times per second. The minute particles are caught on fine hairlike protrusions that line the inside of the mandibles. The suction is created by the thick fleshy tongue, which rests in a groove in the lower mandible and pumps back and forth like a piston.\nThe Chilean flamingo reaches heights of just over 1m and has a black-tipped white bill, dirty \nblue legs, red knees and salmon-colored plumage. The James flamingo is the smallest of the three species and has dark-red legs and a yellow-and-black bill. It\u2019s locally known as jututu . The \nAndean flamingo is the largest of the three and has pink plumage, yellow legs and a yellow-and-black bill.\nEnvironmentalists have been particularly concerned for the birds in recent years, as tourism \nhas affected the flamingos\u2019 breeding.

The 4WD-only road to the Salar \nde Coipasa is extremely poor and the salt is thin so it\u2019s easy to get stuck, especially during the rainy season. If you go, make sure the vehicle and the driver are reliable. The salt-mining village of Coipasa, which (not surprisingly) is constructed mainly of salt, occupies an island in the middle of the salar . You can also reach the Salar de \nCoipasa from Oruro province.\nLagoons\nThe blue lake of  Laguna Celeste  or, more \nromantically, \u2018heaven lake,\u2019 is still very much a peripheral trip for most Uyuni agencies, but it\u2019s gaining popularity with adventurous travelers as a one-day detour.

Discovered in 2003, Gruta de las Galaxias is a small two-level grotto full of beautiful petrified algae and corrals from the ancient lake. Part of the same complex is Cueva del Diablo, a cave sacred to the locals with a pre-Incan cem-etery scattered with small  chullpas .

One of the most popular activities is volcano climbing, with guides easily available in the region\u2019s settlements. Most of the climbs are challenging for the altitude rather than being technically difficult. Taking a guide is a good idea and contributes something to the local communities, which are so often bypassed by the Uyuni-based tours. The most frequently climbed is the Volc\u00e1n Licancabur  (5960m; see p177); it takes about eight hours to climb to the \nsummit, and two to get down. Several Uyuni and Tupiza agencies are happy to include a guided climb of the volcano in a Southwest Circuit route, adding an extra day to the trip. You can normally find a guide somewhere around Laguna Verde \u2013 they tend to charge about US$35 to US$40 for an ascent of the mountain, with a beautiful lagoon at the top, which can be done comfortably (if you handle the altitude) in one day.

Various milky-looking lakes are known as Laguna Blanca , sulfur-\ncolored lakes are Laguna Amarilla  and wine-\ncolored ones are known as Laguna Guinda . \nLaguna Ca\u00f1apa  and Laguna Hedionda  are also \nCHIP AYA\nImmediately north of the Salar de Coipasa, on the R\u00edo Sabaya delta, live the Chipaya people. \nThey occupy two main desert villages (Santa Ana de Chipaya and Ayparavi) of unique circular mud huts known as khuyas  or putucus,  which have doors made from cactus wood and always \nface east. Chipayas are best recognized by their earth-colored clothing and the women\u2019s unique hairstyle, which is plaited African-style into 60 small braids. These are, in turn, joined into two large braids and decorated with a laurake  (barrette) at each temple. \nSome researchers believe the Chipaya were the Altiplano\u2019s first inhabitants, and that they \nmay in fact be a remnant of the lost Tiwanaku civilization. Much of this speculation is based on the fact that their language is vastly different from both Quechua and Aymar\u00e1, and is probably a surviving form of Uru.\nChipaya tradition maintains that they came into the world when it was still dark, and that they \nare descended from the \u2018Men of Water\u2019 \u2013 perhaps the Uru. Their religion, which is nature-based, is complex and symbolic, deifying phallic images, stones, rivers, mountains, animal carcasses and ancestors. The village church tower is worshipped as a demon \u2013 one of 40 named demons who represent hate, ire, vengeance, gluttony and other deadly sins. These are believed to inhabit the whitewashed mud cones that exist within a 15km radius of the village, where they\u2019re appeased with libations, sacrifices and rituals to prevent their evil from invading the village.\nThe reverent commemoration of dead ancestors culminates on November 2, D\u00eda de los Muertos  \n(Day of the Dead), when bodies are disinterred from chullpas  (funerary towers). They\u2019re feted with \na feast, copious drink and coca leaves, and informed about recent village events and the needs of the living. Those who were chiefs, healers and other luminaries are carried to the church where they\u2019re honored with animal sacrifices.\nThe Lauca River, on which the Chipaya have depended for thousands of years, is not only \nheavily polluted but has also been drying out due to global warming. A lot of the Chipaya have emigrated to Chile and the ones left in the community are facing extinction. In the main settlement, Santa Ana de Chipaya, the traditional way of life is slowly vanishing.

The Chipayas don\u2019t like to be photographed but some will do so for a fee (expect to be charged between B$20 and B$100 per photo). There\u2019s a simple alojamiento  in Chipaya village and a small shop. At the time of research, a community \nlodge was under construction and should be up and running by the time you read this.\nFrom Oruro, buses leave daily for Huachacalla; there you\u2019ll have to arrange onward transporta-\ntion to Chipaya, 30km beyond.

Set in spectacular coun-tryside, the capital of Sud Chichas lies in the valley of the R\u00edo Tupiza, surrounded by rugged scenery \u2013 weird eroded rainbow-colored rocks cut by tortuous, gravelly quebradas  (ravines, usually dry) whose \nslopes are studded with cactus.\nThe climate is mild year-round, with \nmost of the rain falling between Novem-ber and March. From June to August, days are hot, dry and clear, but at nighttime the temperatures can drop to below freezing.\nEconomically, the town depends on agri-\nculture and mining. A refinery south of town provides employment, and the country\u2019s only antimony (a flame-retardant metallic element) smelter operates sporadically.\nTupiza and its surroundings have much \nto offer the traveler. Explore the surround-ing hills and canyons on horseback or on foot, check out where the Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid story ended (see boxed text, p187) or just take a few days out to read novels in the pretty central square or by the hotel pool. Tupiza is also an excellent place to embark on a tour of the Southwest Circuit to Uyuni, a four-day route that is attracting growing numbers of travelers.\nHistory\nThe tribe that originally inhabited the region called themselves Chichas and left archaeological evidence of their existence. Despite this, little is known of their culture or language, and it\u2019s assumed they were eth-nically separate from the tribes in neighbor-ing areas of southern Bolivia and northern Argentina.\nOfficially, Tupiza was founded on June 4, \n1574, by Captain Luis de Fuentes (who was also the founder of Tarija). From Tupiza\u2019s inception through the War of Independ-ence, its Spanish population grew steadily, lured by the favorable climate and suitable agricultural lands. Later, the discovery of minerals attracted even more settlers. More recently, campesinos  have drifted in from \nthe countryside and many unemployed miners have settled.\nInformation\nINTERNET & TELEPHONE\nThere are several internet places on the plaza that charge B$3 per hour, as does Entel  \n(cnr Chico, which has a few basic services and \nsupplies, a military post and the Centro de \nEcolog\u00eda Ch\u2019aska , which has an exhibition on \nthe geology and biology of the Los L\u00edpez region, and the lives of the local llama herders. There are also a couple of simple albergues  (hostels) here.\nSoutheast of here, 6km away, is the pic-\nturesque abandoned village of Barrancas , \nwhich nestles against a craggy cliff.\nTo the northeast, and well off the stand-\nard circuit (although visited by some of the tours from Tupiza), the village of San Pablo \nde L\u00edpez  features the latest Tayka property, \nHotel de los Volcanes (see boxed text, p174).\nHeading back toward Uyuni, the village of \nVilla Mar  has an interesting mercado artesanal  \n(craft market) that\u2019s worth a visit. Stretch your legs by strolling the 4km to some of the area\u2019s most spectacular pinturas rupestres  \n(rock paintings), with impressive human figures wearing headdresses, and incised animals.

Professionalism, honesty and flexibility are the things to look for, rather than will-ingness to haggle on the price. The same safety precautions apply as in Uyuni when looking for the right tour operator for you; see p168.\nAll agencies offer horseback riding; there \nare jaunts of three, five or seven hours, or even two or four days. Rates range between B$25 and B$30 per hour; longer rides typically include a lunch of delicious tamales . Two-day rides cost from B$380 \nto $480, with a sleepover in basic accom-modations in the villages of Espicaya or Quiriza. Also on offer by all the agencies is the triathlon, an active full-day tour of the surrounding area by jeep, horse and mountain bike. These range in price between B$200 and B$300 per person with lunch, based on four people. Jeep tours are also available, priced between B$450 and B$600 per day.

They specialize in volcano climbs (Tunupa, Uturuncu or Licancabur), usually tacked onto a standard four-day salar tour (B$1500 for a five-day trip). \nEl Grano de Oro Tours  (% 694-4763; \nelgranodeorotours@hotmail.com; Arraya 492) This family-run agency offers personal service and good local knowledge. The owner\u2019s father has a working farm 12km from Tupiza, where it\u2019s possible to arrange a stay for B$40 per night. This is especially great as part of a two-day horseback route.

Their one-day excursions \nto San Vicente or Huaca Hua\u00f1usca cost B$1200. Their two-day salar  trip with an overnight in Colchani costs pleasant morning or evening outing when \nthe low sun brings out the fiery reds of the surrounding countryside.\nThe permanent Mercado Negro , where you\u2019ll \nencounter a mishmash of consumer goods, occupies an entire block between Santa Cruz and Chichas.

It\u2019s great hiking country and also perfect for exploration on horseback or 4WD \u2013 several window  (% 694-2527) at the  train station opens \nirregularly on days when there\u2019s a train, so it can be easier to have an agency buy your tickets for a small surcharge.\nThe Expreso del Sur  trundles north to \nUyuni ( sal\u00f3n/ejecutivo  B$60/101, five \nhours) and Oruro (B$101/202, 12 hours) at 6:40pm on Wednesday and Saturday. At 3:30am on Tuesday and Friday the Expreso  speeds south to Villaz\u00f3n (B$22/51, \nthree hours), arriving on Wednesday and Saturday.\nThe Wara Wara del Sur,  which is often \ndelayed,  leaves at 6:50pm on Monday and CROSSING THE BORDER TO ARGENTINA\nThe Bolivian side of the main border crossing to Argentina is a sprawling, dusty, chaotic sort of \nplace. The frontier and bus station are always busy, for numerous Bolivians work in Argentina. Watch out for the usual scammers who tend to congregate at borders; dodgy banknotes and petty theft are not unknown.\nThe Argentine consulate  \n(% 597-2011;  Plaza 6 de Agosto 123; h 10am-1pm Mon-Fri)  is on the main \nsquare. Numerous casas de cambio  near the bridge along Av Rep\u00fablica Argentina offer reasonable \nrates of exchange for US dollars and Argentine pesos, less for bolivianos. Banco Mercantil  (JM \nDeheza 423)  changes cash and has an ATM dispensing US dollars and bolivianos. There are several \ninternet places (about B$3 per hour), including ChatMania (20 de Mayo 130)  and Punto Entel  (cnr \nLa Paz & 20 de Mayo) , which also has telephone cabins.\nAll northbound buses depart from the Villaz\u00f3n bus terminal  (fee B$2) . All except those bound \nfor Tarija pass through Tupiza (B$15, 2\u00bd hours); it\u2019s a beautiful trip, so try to go in the daylight and grab a window seat \u2013 at night, it can be a very scary ride. Regular bus services also head to La Paz (B$140 to B$170, 21 hours) via Potos\u00ed (B$80 to B$120, 11 hours) and Oruro (B$140 to B$160, 17 hours). Daily evening buses along the rough but amazing route to Tarija (B$40, seven to eight hours) continue to Bermejo (there are four onward departures per day). Argentine bus companies have ticket offices opposite Villaz\u00f3n\u2019s terminal, but all Argentine buses leave from the La Quiaca bus terminal. You\u2019ll be hassled by ticket sellers for both Argentine and Bolivian bus services; don\u2019t be rushed into buying a ticket, as there may be a service leaving sooner. You can easily bargain down the price on longer routes; conversely, the sellers may try and overcharge you on shorter journeys. \nThe Villaz\u00f3n train station\n is 1.5km north of the border crossing \u2013 a taxi costs B$5. The Expreso \ndel Sur  departs Wednesday and Saturday at 3:30pm for Tupiza ( sal\u00f3n/ejecutivo  B$22/51, 2\u00be hours), \nUyuni (B$63/152, 8\u00bd hours) and Oruro (B$109/236, 16\u00bd hours).

The right fork of the wash is rather comically known as Valle de los \nMachos  (Valley of Males) or Valle de los \nPenes (Valley of Penises). The names stem from the clusters of exceptionally phallic pedestal formations.\nAnother scenic sight near Tupiza is El An-\ngosto , a spectacular tunnel of a road carved \ninto the mountain \u2013 great for photographs. \nHuaca Hua\u00f1usca & San Vicente\nKid, the next time I say let\u2019s go some-place like Bolivia, let\u2019s go someplace like Bolivia!\nPaul Newman, in the film \nButch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid\nNovember 4, 1908, Robert LeRoy Parker \n(Butch Cassidy) and Harry Alonzo Longa-baugh (the Sundance Kid) pulled off the last robbery of their careers when they politely and peacefully relieved Carlos Per\u00f3 of the Aramayo company payroll, which amounted to US$90,000, at the foot of a hill called Huaca Hua\u00f1usca  (Dead Cow). The \nname was apparently applied because of the hill\u2019s resemblance to a fallen bovine. From an obvious pass on the ridge, a walking track descends the steep slopes to the west for about 2km to the river, where there\u2019s a small meadow, a tiny cave and some rug-ged rock outcrops where the bandits prob-ably holed up while waiting for the payroll to pass. Several Tupiza agencies offer jeep trips to Huaca Hua\u00f1usca.\nSan Vicente  is a remote one-mule vil-\nlage that wouldn\u2019t even rate a mention were it not the legendary spot where the outlaws met their untimely demise (see boxed text, opposite). The mine in San Vicente is now closed and the place has declined to little more than a ghost town. Most of those remaining are military peo-ple, mine security guards and their fami-lies. To be honest, even hardcore Butch and Sundance fans are sometimes a little disap-pointed by the place, a dusty spot with a tiny museum  (\nadmission B$10 ) and little tourist \ninfrastructure. The museum is often closed, with the key-holder often difficult to track down. Bring your imagination: you can Tupiza operators offer these excursions (see p182).\nIf you\u2019re hiking without a guide, it\u2019s \nnot easy to get lost, but take a map any-way \u2013 you can get them from various tour agencies. Carry at least 3L of water per day in this dry desert climate. It\u2019s wise to wear shoes that can withstand assault by prickly desert vegetation, and to carry a compass or GPS if you\u2019re venturing away from the tracks. Flash flooding is also a danger, particularly in the summer months; avoid camping in the quebradas or entering the \ncanyons, especially if it looks like rain.\nJust northwest of Tupiza is Quebrada \nde Palala , a broad wash lined with some \nvery impressive red formations known as fins. During the rainy season it becomes a tributary of the R\u00edo Tupiza, but in the winter months it serves as a highway into the back country and part of the salt route from the Salar de Uyuni to Tarija. Beyond the dramatic red rocks, the wash rises very gently into hills colored greenish-blue and violet by lead and other mineral deposits. To get here, head north on Tupiza\u2019s Av La Paz from Plazuela El Mundo past the giant slide; 2km ahead, along the railroad line, you\u2019ll see the mouth of the quebrada . About \n5km further along, the route passes some obvious fin formations and continues up the broad quebrada  into increasingly lonely \ncountry, past scrub brush and cacti stands.\nTwo canyons, El Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Duende  and El \nCa\u00f1\u00f3n del Inca  are part of most itineraries. \nThe first can be reached from Tupiza on a great half-day stroll; ask any of the agencies for a map and directions.

While casing banks to finance their retirement, the outlaws learned of an even sweeter target: a poorly guarded US$480,000 mine-company payroll to be hauled by mule from Tupiza to Quechisla.\nOn November 3, 1908, manager Carlos Per\u00f3 picked up a packet of cash from Aramayo, Francke \n& Compa\u00f1\u00eda in Tupiza and headed north with his 10-year-old son and a servant, but they were discreetly tailed by Butch and Sundance. Per\u00f3\u2019s party overnighted in Salo, then set off again at dawn. As the trio ascended the hill called Huaca Hua\u00f1usca, the bandits watched from above with binoculars. In a rugged spot on the far side of the hill, they relieved Per\u00f3 of a handsome mule and the remittance, which turned out to be a mere US$90,000 \u2013 the prized payroll had been slated for shipment the following week.\nDispirited, Butch and Sundance returned to Francis\u2019 headquarters at Tomahuaico. The following \nday, Francis guided them to Estarca, where the three of them spent the night. On the morning of November 6, the bandits bade farewell to Francis and headed west to San Vicente.\nMeanwhile, Per\u00f3 had sounded the alarm, and posses were scouring southern Bolivia. A four-\nman contingent from Uyuni reached San Vicente that afternoon. Butch and Sundance arrived at dusk, rented a room from Bonifacio Casasola and sent him to fetch supper. The posse came to investigate and had scarcely entered the courtyard when Butch shot and killed a soldier. Dur-ing the brief gunfight that ensued, Sundance was badly wounded. Realizing that escape was impossible, Butch ended Sundance\u2019s misery with a shot between the eyes, then fired a bullet into his own temple.\nAt the inquest, Carlos Per\u00f3 identified the corpses as those of the men who had robbed him. \nAlthough buried as desconocidos (unknowns) in the cemetery, the outlaws fit descriptions of Butch \nand Sundance, and a mountain of circumstantial evidence points to their having met their doom in San Vicente. For example, Santiago Lowe, Butch\u2019s well-known alias, was recently found among the hotel guest list published in the Tupiza newspaper just a few days before the Aramayo holdup, which confirms eyewitness accounts that he was there. Nonetheless, rumors of their return to the USA have made their fate one of the great mysteries of the American West.\nIn 1991 a team led by forensic anthropologist Clyde Snow attempted to settle the question by \nexcavating the bandits\u2019 grave. No one in the village had any knowledge of its location, except one elderly \u2013 and as it turned out, imaginative \u2013 gentleman, who led them to a specific tombstone. The grave\u2019s sole occupant turned out to be a German miner named Gustav Zimmer.\nAnne Meadows is the author of Digging Up Butch and Sundance , University of Nebraska Press, 2003\n14-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   18714-southern-altiplano-bol7.indd   187 9/12/09   17:27:399/12/09   17:27:39", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3878, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd3e2f35-1ae9-4ab0-b6e7-9dce05ea091e": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd3e2f35-1ae9-4ab0-b6e7-9dce05ea091e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c59b0268-8cae-45a1-ac75-cdda5f7ca97f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "96de2449552208b84d33da978ed0b75ebb8b59411ec76f9d639d1c81da4d072f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "188\n \u0084  TELEPHONE CODE: 4 \u0084  POPULATION: 3 MILLION                     \u0084  ELEVATION 1600M TO 5400MCENTRAL HIGHLANDSCentral Highlands\nThe Central Highlands are not only located at the heart of the country, but for many repre-\nsent the spiritual heart of the nation.

In practice, however, it had been administered from Buenos Aires and disputes arose about what to do with the territory.\nOn February 9, 1825 Bol\u00edvar\u2019s second-\nin-command, General Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, drafted and delivered a declar-ation that rejected Buenos Aires authority and suggested that the political future of the region should be determined by the provinces themselves.\nBol\u00edvar, unhappy with this unauthorized \nact of sovereignty, rejected the idea, but de Sucre stood his ground, convinced that there was sufficient separatist sentiment in Alto Peru to back him up. As he expected, the people of the region staunchly refused to wait for a decision from the new con-gress, which was to be installed in Lima the following year, and also rejected subse-quent invitations to join up with the Buenos Aires government.CENTRAL HIGHLANDS  \u2022\u2022  History   189\nHistory\nPrior to Spanish domination, the town of \nCharcas, where Sucre now stands, was the indigenous capital of the valley of Choque-Chaca. It served as the residence of local religious, military and political leaders, and its jurisdiction extended to several thousand inhabitants. When th e Spanish arrived, the \nentire area from Southern Peru to the R\u00edo de la Plata in present-day Argentina came to be known as Charcas.\nIn the early 1530s Francisco Pizarro, the \nconquistador who felled the Inca empire, sent his brother Gonzalo to the Charcas region to oversee indigenous mining activi-ties that might prove to be valuable to the Spanish realm. He was not interested in the Altiplano, and concentrated on the high-lands east of the main Andean cordilleras. As a direct result, in 1538 a new Spanish capital of the Charcas was founded. Follow-ing in the conquered population\u2019s footsteps, he chose the warm, fertile valley of Choque-Chaca for its site. The city, later to become Sucre, was named La Plata \u2013 silver was God in those days.\nWhereas previously all territories in the \nregion had been governed from Lima, in 1559 King Felipe II created the Audiencia (Royal Court) of Charcas, with its head-quarters in the young city, to help admin-ister the eastern territories. Governmental subdivisions within the district came under the jurisdiction of royal officers known as corregidores .\nIn 1776, a new Viceroyalty was established \nin what is now Buenos Aires, and the Charcas came under its control. The city became known as Chuquisaca (a Spanish corruption of Choque-Chaca), as there were too many La Platas around for comfort.\nThe city had received an archbishopric \nin 1609, according it theological autonomy. That, along with the establishment of the University of San Xavier in 1622 and the 1681 opening of the Academ\u00eda Carolina law school, fostered continued development of liberal and revolutionary ideas and set the stage for \u2018the first cry of Independence in the Americas\u2019 on May 25, 1809.

While much of the city\u2019s population is typically poor, parts of town have a notably prosperous feel. The spacious new-town avenues have a wide choice of restaur-ants, eagerly grazed by the food-crazy cochabambinos , and the bar life is lively, \ndriven by students and young professionals. Despite this, Cochabamba remains a very affordable city, with prices far below those in Sucre or La Paz. You could easily find yourself staying a lot longer than you planned.\nThe city\u2019s name is derived from the \nQuechua khocha  pampa,  meaning \u2018swampy \nplain.\u2019 Cochabamba lies in a fertile green bowl, 25km long by 10km wide, set in a landscape of fields and low hills. To the northwest rises Cerro Tunari (5035m), the highest peak in central Bolivia. The area\u2019s rich soil yields abundant crops of maize, barley, wheat, alfalfa, and orchard and citrus fruits. Cochabamba is famous for its chicha,  a fermented corn drink that is the \nlocals\u2019 favorite tipple. \nHistory\nCochabamba was founded in January 1574 by Sebasti\u00e1n Barba de Padilla. It was origi-nally named Villa de Oropeza in honor of the Count and Countess of Oropeza, parents of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, who char-tered and promoted its settlement.\nDuring the height of Potos\u00ed\u2019s silver \nboom, the Cochabamba Valley developed into the primary source of food for the miners in agriculturally unproductive Potos\u00ed. Thanks to its maize and wheat production, Cochabamba came to be the \u2018breadbasket of Bolivia.\u2019 As Potos\u00ed\u2019s importance declined during the early 18th century, so did Cochabamba\u2019s, and grain production in the Chuquisaca (Sucre) area, much closer to Potos\u00ed, was sufficient to supply the decreasing demand.\nBy the mid-19th century, however, the \ncity had reassumed its position as the nation\u2019s granary. Elite landowners in the valley grew wealthy and began invest-ing in highland mining ventures. Before long, the Altiplano mines were attract-ing international capital, and the focus of Bolivian mining shifted from Potos\u00ed to southwestern Bolivia. As a result, On August 6, the first anniversary of the \nBattle of Jun\u00edn, independence was declared in the Casa de la Libertad at Chuquisaca and the new republic was christened Bolivia, after its liberator. On August 11 the city\u2019s name was changed for the final time to Sucre, in honor of the general who\u2019d promoted the independence movement.\nDifficult years followed in the young \nrepublic, and Bol\u00edvar commented on his namesake, \u2018Hapless Bolivia has had four different leaders in less than two weeks! Only the kingdom of Hell could offer so appalling a picture discrediting humanity!\u2019\nFor more on the region\u2019s fascinating past, \nsee the History sections of Cochabamba (opposite) and Potos\u00ed (p229).\nClimate\nThe saying \u2018Las golondrinas nunca migran \nde Cochabamba\u2019  (The swallows never \nmigrate from Cochabamba) aptly describes what cochabambinos  believe is the world\u2019s \nmost comfortable climate, with warm, dry, sunny days and cool nights.

The World Bank had forced the Bolivian government to sell off its water company to US giant Bechtel in order to provide financing for a tunnel that would bring water from the other side of the mountains. The resultant price rise brought the citizens out in force, with several hun-dred thousand people taking to the streets in protest and eventually driving Bechtel out. Anti-globalization campaigners around the world saw it as a highly symbolic victory over a multinational that had bullied the Bolivian government with the complicity of the World Bank. \nOrientation\nCochabamba is a large, sprawling city, but its business district, centered on the Plaza 14 de Septiembre, is compact. The largest market zones are on, or south of, Av Aroma, sandwiched between Colina San Sebasti\u00e1n and Laguna Alalay. The long-distance bus terminal and most of the intravalley bus terminals are also in this area.\nCochabamba addresses are often meas-\nured relative to the crossroads of two main avenues, Hero\u00ednas (running east\u2013west) and Ayacucho (north\u2013south). Numbers on streets that cross Hero\u00ednas are preceded by \u2018N\u2019 (norte) to the north of the avenue and \u2018S\u2019 \n(sud; south) to the south.

The first deals primarily with indigenous culture from the Cochabamba region. Look out for the Tiwanaku section; their shamans used to snort lines of hal-lucinogenic powder through elegant bone tubes.

Visits to this \ntimeless and gracefully decaying complex \nTHE NUNS OF SANTA TERESA\nThe Santa Teresa convent in Cochabamba houses what remains of an order of cloistered Carmelite \nnuns. A strict Catholic order with a strong devotion to the Virgin Mary, the Carmelites are thought to have been founded in the 12th century on Mt Carmel (hence the name). The order believes strongly in the power of contemplative prayer, and shuns the excesses of society.\nIn recent times, and with local families believing that a daughter in the convent guaranteed \nthe entire family a place in heaven, there was strong pressure on the first daughter of every cochabambino  family to enter into the convent. Such was the demand to buy some real estate \nin heaven that there was even a waiting list set up when no vacancies were available. An elderly nun had to pass on before a new young nun was allowed in.\nLife inside was tough and a rigid class system operated. Those who paid a considerable dowry \n(equivalent to over US$150,000 in modern money) earned themselves a velo negro  (black veil) and \na place on the council under the control of the Mother Superior. The council was responsible for all the decisions in the convent. As the elite members of the order, velo negro  were blessed with \na private stone room with a single window (more like a prison cell), where they spent most of their day in prayer, religious study and other acceptable activities such as sewing tapestries. \nEach velo negro  was attended by members of the velo blanco (white veil), second-class nuns \nwhose family paid some dowry but could not afford the full cost of a velo negro . Velo blanco  nuns \nspent part of their day in prayer and the rest in personal service of the velo negro . Daughters \nof poor families who could not afford any kind of dowry became sin velos  (without veil). These \nwere employed in the roughest chores of the convent, cooking, cleaning and attending to the needs of the velo blanco . These nuns slept in communal quarters. \nThe rules inside the convent were strict. Personal effects were not permitted and communication \nwith other nuns was allowed for only one hour a day \u2013 the rest was spent in total silence. Meals were eaten without speaking and contact with the outside world was almost completely prohibited. Once a month each nun was allowed a brief visit from their family, but this took place behind bars and with a black curtain preventing them from seeing and touching each other. Visits were supervised to ensure that no rules were broken and no goods changed hands. The only other contact with the city was through the sale of candles and foodstuffs, which was performed via a revolving door so that the vendor and the client were kept apart. Such transactions were the sole source of income for the nuns who were otherwise completely self-sufficient.\nIn the 1960s the Vatican declared that such conditions were inhuman and offered all cloistered \nnuns the world over the opportunity to change to a more modern way of life.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4142, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba56b9ff-29e4-417a-84ee-ffcf3bcd1429": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba56b9ff-29e4-417a-84ee-ffcf3bcd1429", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68681ad7-377f-490b-9fe7-d5be92724800", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "1a71c300474d3e00cc12bcbafc1a0e2f31233695241634cca76f169deb1654e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb8af1bf-821a-4ccc-8305-9b36ab4a5767", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "503410519f3ffb363178f2544f796d0f5dfa5af8431d9f90d541d17c4c5eb469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Personal effects were not permitted and communication \nwith other nuns was allowed for only one hour a day \u2013 the rest was spent in total silence.

Today just 12 nuns remain in Santa Teresa, most of advancing years, and whilst the rules are no longer as strict as they once were, the practices have changed little. These days the cloistered lifestyle is understandably less attractive to young girls in an age where their families permit them to exercise their own free will.\n15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   195 15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   195 8/12/09   09:23:18 8/12/09   09:23:18", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3172, "end_char_idx": 4719, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd8802f8-3d42-4cb0-8e5b-667328f878c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd8802f8-3d42-4cb0-8e5b-667328f878c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02731a81-bb76-4928-9d67-ddb61340e9a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "c0a6b2ef2e8daf98472ee72bea600127e744dde7a0e1c1fd2c319a58f94bb2a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "119d5236-2fc1-40b2-91ce-57cc662a902c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf899d190e6d0cc78175a6fded201a410a3667c90a1fd8238e5ea423cb08cb99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comCENTRAL HIGHLANDS196    CENTRAL HIGHLANDS  \u2022\u2022  Cochabamba\ntelef\u00e9rico  (cable car; return B$6; h closed Mon) .

There are statues of several saints, a gilded altarpiece and a grotto for the ever-popular Inmaculada (Virgin of the Immaculate Conception).\nConstructed in 1581, the Iglesia & Convento \nde San Francisco  \n(25 de Mayo & Bol\u00edvar; h 7:30-11am)  \nis Cochabamba\u2019s second-oldest church. Major revisions and renovation occurred in 1782 and 1925, however, and little of the original structure remains. The attached convent and cloister were added in the 1600s. The cloister was constructed of wood rather than the stone that was customary \nat the time.

It encom-passes a wide diversity of habitats from dry inter-Andean valleys to the more humid and highly endangered Polylepis  forests of \nthe Cordillera Tunari. \nThe SERNAP office in Cochabamba \n(p193) may have simple walking maps of the park, but often finds itself without material.\nCochabamba Area\nA good dirt road zigzags its way from the park gate (open until 4pm) up the steep mountain face. About 3km after the gate, you\u2019ll reach a picnic site  with barbecues and \na playground. Beyond here is a sendero \necol\u00f3gico  (nature trail). Don\u2019t expect too \nmuch in the way of ecolog\u00eda,  but it\u2019s a \nwell-made path that gains altitude rapidly, winding into thickening mature woodland. The views are tremendous, with Cochabamba spread out below, and in the opposite direction, Cerro Tunari and the Cordillera. With an early start and plenty of water, you should be able to make it up to some of the nearer peaks on a long day hike.\nComing from town, take micro F2  or trufi \n35 from Av San Mart\u00edn, which will drop you \nthree minutes from the park entrance, a big wooden archway with a fire-risk indicator. You may have to show ID and sign into the park. From the gate, turn right, then turn left after 100m; the road zigzags up past the playground to the lakes.\nCerro Tunari Area\nSnow-dusted Cerro Tunari (5035m) is the highest peak in central Bolivia (it\u2019s the second peak from the left on the Taqui\u00f1a beer label). Its flanks are 25km west of Cochabamba along the road to Independ-encia. This spectacular area offers excellent hiking and camping, but access is less than straightforward. For climbs, pick up the 1:50,000 map Cordillera de Tunari  (sheet \n6342III) from the IGM (p191).\nFrom Quillacollo (p202) it\u2019s a compli-\ncated four- to five-hour ascent to the sum-mit, with some sections requiring technical equipment. Experienced climbers can man-age the round-trip in a long day, but the high-altitude ascent will be more pleasant long-distance routes for about twice the price of those listed here.\nThere are at least 20 buses daily to La Paz \n(B$45, seven hours). Most leave between 7am and 9pm. Numerous flotas  (long-distance \nbus companies) run daily services to Oruro (B$25, four hours). Most Santa Cruz buses (B$30 to B$66, 8 to 13 hours) depart before 9am or after 6pm; more expensive ones take the old Chapare road, cheaper ones the new. \nFrequent buses leave for Sucre (B$40 to \nB$80, 10 to 12 hours) between 4:30pm and 6:30pm daily. Some then continue on to Potos\u00ed (B$52, 15 hours).

Apart from the Sunday market  and the pre-Inca burial mound  \ndiscovered beneath Plaza Bol\u00edvar, the main attraction is in its church, the revered Virgen \nde Urkupi\u00f1a . Tradition has it that long ago, \nthe Virgin Mary appeared several times to a shepherd girl at the foot of the hill known as Calvario. The visits were later witnessed by the girl\u2019s parents and a crowd of villagers if you allow two days and camp overnight. You\u2019ll need a guide to find the best route.\nAn easier route ascends from Estancia \nChaqueri or Tawa Cruz, 12km beyond Cruce Liriuni (which has accommodations at the village school) at 4200m. Micros  \nand camiones (flatbed trucks)  toward Mo-\nrochata leave on Monday, Thursday and Saturday at 7am from three blocks off the main plaza in Quillacollo; they return to Cochabamba in the afternoon on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday.

On \nother days, take a micro  from the same spot \nto Plaza Bol\u00edvar in Quillacollo and then a trufi  or a micro  to Sipe Sipe.\nInca-Rakay\nThe ruins of Inca-Rakay, in the Serran\u00eda de \nTarhuani, are mostly crumbling stone walls these days, and you\u2019ll need some imagin-ation to conjure up their former glory. It has been postulated that Inca-Rakay served as an Inca administrative outpost, which oversaw agricultural colonies in the fertile Cochabamba Valley. That seems unlikely, however, given its lofty position and the difficulty of access.\nThe site includes the remains of several \nhefty buildings, and a large open plaza overlooking the valley. One odd rock out-crop resembles the head of a condor, with a natural passageway inside leading to the top. Just off the plaza area is a cave that may be explored with a flashlight. Legend has it that this cave is the remnant of another of those apocryphal Inca tunnels \u2013 this one linking Inca-Rakay with faraway Cuzco. If you\u2019re there on a smog-free day, the plaza affords a spectacular overview of the valley.\nThe rare Spanish-language book \nInkallajta & Inkaraqay,  by Jes\u00fas Lara, con-\ntains good site maps and theories about its origins and purposes.\nGETTING THERE & AWAY\nInca-Rakay is accessed on foot from Sipe Sipe. Since staying overnight is not a safe option, you must get an early start out of Cochabamba; the trip takes the better part of a day and you\u2019ll need time to explore the ruins.\nIt\u2019s a 5km, 2\u00bd-hour cross-country (but \nwell-signed) walk up a steep hill from Sipe Sipe to the site. From the southwest corner of Sipe Sipe\u2019s main plaza, follow the when she shouted \u2018Orkopi\u00f1a\u2019 (There on \nthe hill!) as the Virgin was seen ascending heavenwards. At the summit of the hill, the townspeople discovered the stone image of the Virgin, which now stands in the church to the right of the altar, surrounded by vo-tive offerings and commemorative plaques giving thanks for blessings received.\nOne thing to do here is to sample \ngarapi\u00f1a,  a deceptively strong blend of \nchicha  (fermented corn), cinnamon, coco-\nnut and ayrampo,  which is a local mystery \ningredient that colors the drink red.\nFESTIVALS & EVENTS\nFrom August 14 to 18 is the Fiesta de la Virgen \nde Urkupi\u00f1a , which is the biggest annual \ncelebration in Cochabamba department. Folkloric musicians and dancers come from around Bolivia to perform, and the chicha  flows for three days. It can be a fairly \nchaotic scene, with more attention paid to hitting the bottle than on reverence. It\u2019s also very crowded.\nSLEEPING & EATING\nAt Estancia Marquina, 5km north of Quilla-collo, is Eco-Hotel Planeta de Luz  \n(% 426-1234; \nwww.planetadeluz.com; camping per person B$15, full board s/d B$200/280, 3\u20134-person cabins/ste B$525; s )\n, a \ncurious place with Gaud\u00edesque architecture, spa treatments, a sauna, wandering domes-tic animals and a kooky New Age vibe.

This was the easternmost outpost of the Inca empire and after Tiwanaku it\u2019s the country\u2019s most significant archaeological site. The most prominent feature is the immense stone fortifi  c ation that sprawls across alluvial terraces above the river, but at least 50 other structures are also scattered around the 12-hectare site.\nIncallajta was probably founded by Inca \nEmperor Tupac Yupanqui, the commander who had previously marched into present-day Chile to demarcate the southern lim-its of the Inca empire. It\u2019s estimated that Incallajta was constructed in the 1460s as a measure of protection against attack by the Chiriguanos to the southeast. In 1525, the last year of Emperor Huayna Capac\u2019s rule, the outpost was abandoned. This may have been due to a Chiriguano attack, but was more likely the result of increasing Spanish pressure and the unraveling of the empire, which fell seven years later.\nThe site is on a monumental scale; some \nresearchers believe that, as well as serving a defensive purpose, it was designed as a sort of ceremonial replica of Cuzco, the Inca capital. The site\u2019s most significant building, the kallanka,  measures a colossal 80m by \n25m. The roof was supported by immense columns. Outside it is a large boulder, prob-ably a speakers\u2019 platform. At the western end of the site is a curious six-sided tower, perhaps used for astronomical observation. On the hilltop, a huge zigzag defensive wall has a baffled defensive entrance.\nThe ruins were made known to the world \nin 1914 by Swedish zoologist and ethnolo-gist Ernest Nordenski\u00f6ld, who spent a week at the ruins, measuring and mapping them. However, they were largely ignored \u2013 except by ruthless treasure hunters \u2013 for the next 50 years, until the University of San Sim\u00f3n in Cochabamba launched its investigations. \nAt Pocona, 17km from the ruins, \nthere\u2019s an information centre and a small exhibition of archaeological finds from the site..geocities.com/alpacaworks/home.html; Bolivia 180) , a \nwomen\u2019s cooperative where you can browse their existing stock or order a customized Western-style sweater.\nTarata & Huayculli\nTarata, 29km southeast of Cochabamba, is one of the region\u2019s loveliest towns, a pictur-esque but decaying beauty that\u2019s well worth a visit for its noble buildings, cobbled streets and gorgeous plaza, filled with palm trees and jacarandas. The town\u2019s name is derived from the abundant tara trees, whose fruit \nis used in curing leather. Tarata is famous as the birthplace of the mad president General Mariano Melgarejo, who held of-fice from 1866 to 1871 and whose remains now lie in the town church. While the citizens aren\u2019t necessarily proud of his achievements, they\u2019re pretty proud of pro-ducing presidents (populist military leader Ren\u00e9 Barrientos, who ruled from 1964 to 1969, was also born here), so there\u2019s a huge horseback statue of him on the main road.\nThe enormous neoclassical Iglesia de San \nPedro  was constructed in 1788 and restored \nbetween 1983 and 1985; several of the in-terior panels include mestizo-style details carved in cedar. The 1792 Franciscan Convent \nof San Jos\u00e9 , which contains lovely colonial \nfurniture and an 8000-volume library, was founded as a missionary training school. It now operates as a museum and contains the ashes of San Severino, Tarata\u2019s patron saint, whose feast day is celebrated on the last Sunday in November.\nThe village also has several other historic \nbuildings : the Palacio Consistorial (gov-\nernment palace) of President Melgarejo (built in 1872) and the homes of President Melgarejo, General Don Esteban Arce and General Ren\u00e9 Barrientos.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3905, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d604b5e-a6ee-41e6-a39a-4607f29452c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d604b5e-a6ee-41e6-a39a-4607f29452c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67e4cf2a-1174-4d8e-8c72-35f519e963ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "8349ed0aea27dbdbeb08423365aef50e42830d38a1ea7a7b91ea70265feeb109", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "848b2434-3d28-4b55-bbe8-66e038b116c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "bd03ce77ac48b67a8f4d4a46f53e84a9a8560c45b6af40f401247b6dc89152b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The enormous neoclassical Iglesia de San \nPedro  was constructed in 1788 and restored \nbetween 1983 and 1985; several of the in-terior panels include mestizo-style details carved in cedar.

There\u2019s also a small archaeological and historical museum . Monday is market day .\nWith the help of Peace Corps volunteers, \nthe alcald\u00eda  (on the north side of the plaza) \norganizes self-guided hiking circuits and guided \ntrips to several local sites of natural and his-\ntoric interest. Moises Cardozo at the Entel office or Restaurant Plaza will arrange an interesting visit to his apiary  just outside \nof town.\nBesides its cheese and honey, Mizque is \nbest known for its Fer\u00eda de la Fruta (April 19), \nwhich coincides with the chirimoya  (cus-\ntard apple) harvest and Semana Santa . From \nSeptember 8 to 14, Mizque holds the lively Fiesta del Se\u00f1or de Burgos , which features \nmuch revelry and bull- and cockfighting.\nSleeping & Eating\nResidencial Mizque  (% 434-2039; r per person B$25) \nSet amid gardens, this clean place is the \neasiest to find if you arrive at night \u2013 look for the Prodem sign.Tours\nCochabamba agencies run day-long tours to Incallajta when they have a group large enough to make it worthwhile. Fremen Tours  \n(p196) is recommended. Beware of tours that seem suspiciously cheap or that involve \u2018trekking.\u2019 These generally involve getting a cab to the cruce  (turnoff) and walking \nup to the site \u2013 you can do that yourself.\nSleeping & Eating\nWithout your own transportation, visiting Incallajta will prove inconvenient at best. Additionally, if you can\u2019t arrange lodging in private homes, you\u2019ll probably have to camp for two or three nights, so be sure to take plenty of water, food, warm cloth-ing and camping gear. Camping and basic shelters are available at the Centro de Investi gaciones in Pocona.\nGetting There & Away\nTaxis (B$18, three hours) and micros  (B$15, \nfive hours) to Pocona leave Cochabamba when full between 5am and 7pm from the corner of Rep\u00fablica and Manuripi. Get off at the turnoff for the site at Collpa. From here it\u2019s an 8km uphill walk. Pocona is a further 9km past Collpa. \nTOTORA\nTotora, 142km east of Cochabamba, hud-dles in a valley at the foot of Cerro Su-tuchira. It is on the main route between Cochabamba and Sucre, but few travel-ers ever see it because most buses pass through at night. Nevertheless it is a lovely colonial village, built around a postcard-pretty plaza with colorful buildings and arcades.

Beds of sedimen-tary mudstone, sandstone and limestone, bristling with marine fossils and \u2013 from drier periods \u2013 dinosaur footprints, have been muscled and twisted into the sharp, inhospitable hillscapes of the Serran\u00eda de Huayllas and Serran\u00eda de C\u00f3ndor Khaka. In places, the immensity of geological time is showcased, with exposed layers revealing fossils below a hundred meters or more of sedimentary strata.\nAmidst it all, the characterful, impov-\nerished colonial village of Torotoro itself (2720m) is one of the region\u2019s most remote settlements (although road access is steadily improving).\nInformation & Registration\nInformation about the park is sometimes available from the SERNAP office in Cochabamba (p193), but don\u2019t bank on it. You may have more luck at one of the tour companies or online at www.torotoro-bolivia.com (in Spanish). On the main street in the village of Torotoro, the tourist office  \n(Charcas s/n; h daily) is housed in the entrance \nof the alcald\u00eda . This is where you contract \nguides and register for your visit to the park (B$20). Hang on to your ticket at all times as it will be inspected by park rangers.\nOn the main street in Torotoro, there\u2019s \nan Entel office  \n(% 413-5736) , which also has \ninternet access.\nGUIDES\nIn order to protect the park\u2019s geological wonders, it is compulsory to take a guide on any excursion outside the village. The best place to find a guide is at the park office \u2013 ask for \u2018un gu\u00eda confiable\u2019  (a reliable guide), Hotel Bolivia (% 434-2158; r per person B$20, with \nbathroom B$40)  Next to the campesino  (sub-\nsistence farmer) market on the road to the river, Hotel Bolivia has firm beds and is probably the nicest place in town. \nHostal Graciela  \n(% 413-5616; r per person with \nbathroom B$40)  A good option with rooms \nthat have decks; it\u2019s affiliated with the also recommended Restaurant Plaza. \nMizque has several cheap Taqui\u00f1a-\nsponsored  alojamientos  that serve typical \nBolivian meals. They\u2019re all within a block of the plaza. Alternatively, you can eat at the street stalls beside the church.\nGetting There & Away\nThree daily micros  (B$15, four hours) \nleave Cochabamba from the corner of Avs 6 de Agosto and Rep\u00fablica at noon, 2pm and 6pm; from Mizque they depart for Cochabamba at 8am, 10am and noon and for Aiquile at 3pm daily.

At the base of the ravine you may see petrified shark teeth, while higher up, the limestone and sedimen-tary layers are set with fossils of ancient trilobites, echinoderms, gastropods, ar-thropods, cephalopods and brachiopods. The site is thought to date back about 350 million years. There\u2019s another major sea-fossil site in the Quebrada Thajo Khasa , south-\neast of Torotoro.\nPachamama Wasi\nThis amazing and beautiful house-museum  \n(Sucre s/n; admission B$5)  is the quirky home of \na man who has spent years of his life pac-ing the cerros (hills) with a rockhound\u2019s eye. The house is like a botanic garden, but made of stones: fossils, geological quirks and unusually shaped rocks form a unique, soothing ensemble. It\u2019s uphill from the main street but only open when the owner or his family are at home.\nCa\u00f1\u00f3n de Torotoro & El Vergel\nThree kilometers from Torotoro, the ground suddenly drops away into an immense and spectacularly beautiful canyon, over 250m deep. From the mirador (viewpoint) at the top, you can gaze along it, watching vul-tures wheeling. The cliffside here is also home to the rare paraba frente roja  (Red-\nfronted macaw; p316), which you have a good chance of seeing, or at least hearing.\nFrom here, following the diminishing \ncanyon along to the left, you come to a flight of 800 stairs that lead down to El Vergel (also called Huacasenq\u2019a, meaning \u2018cow\u2019s nostrils\u2019 in Quechua), which always has water and is filled with incongruous moss, vines and other tropical vegetation. At the bottom a crystal-clear river tum-bles down through cascades and waterfalls, forming idyllic swimming pools.\nBatea Q\u2019ocha Rock Paintings\nAbove the third bend of the R\u00edo Torotoro, 1.5km downstream from the village, are several panels of ancient rock paintings collectively called Batea Q\u2019ocha because as your visit will be greatly enhanced. Be aware that your guide is very unlikely to speak English.\nThe going rate for a guide is around \nB$45 for a half-day excursion for up to four people, more for a visit to the Gruta de Umajalanta. For dinosaur footprints, it can be very helpful if the guide has a brush (otherwise buy one) to whisk the dust out of the hollows. If you are going to the cave, the guide should have head-lanterns and rope.\nDinosaur Tracks\nMost visitors to Torotoro come for the pale-ontology. The village, which sits in a wide section of a 20km-long valley at a 2600m elevation, is flanked by enormous, inclined mudstone rock formations, bearing bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaur tracks from the Cretaceous period (spanning 145 million to 65 million years ago).\nThere are numerous tracks (huellas) all \nover the place, and much work remains to be done on their interpretation.

A few Cochabamba agencies (p196) run trips, including visits to the major sights. One of the best is Bolivia Cultura (p196).\nFestivals & Events\nFrom July 24 to 27, the village stages the Fiesta del Se\u00f1or Santiago , which features \nsheep sacrifices, dynamite explosions, colorful costumes, much chicha  and some \nlight tinku  (traditional Bolivian fighting; \nsee boxed text, p237). This is an interest-ing time to visit \u2013 and there\u2019s much more public transportation than usual \u2013 but the natural attractions are very crowded.\nSleeping & Eating\nThere are several downmarket residenciales  \n(simple accommodations) in Torotoro, but few that are much more than huts with signs. One that\u2019s substantially better is Hostal Las Hermanas  \n(Cochabamba; r B$40) , which \nis simple but clean and comfortable, with hot water; it\u2019s on the street that enters the village, on the left.\nVilla Etelvina  \n(% 7073-7807; www.villaetelvina\n.com; Sucre s/n; r per person B$120, 4-person bungalow B$400)\n The best option in town, this is a com-\nfortable and welcoming oasis. As well as having extremely comfortable and stylish accommodation, they put on some of the most delicious home cooking you\u2019re likely to find on your travels in Bolivia. Vege-tarian fare is available on request, and is particularly good. The owners can organise transfers from Cochabamba, tours in the area and mountain-bike descents as part of the trip. Book ahead, as they need notice to be able to accompany guests. \nIf you wish to camp, locals will expect \nyou to pay. It\u2019s important to set a mutually agreeable price and pay only the family in control of the land.\nGetting There & Away\nParque Nacional Torotoro is 135km south-east of Cochabamba in Potos\u00ed department. The road has been improved in recent years, and works are continuing, but more than half the distance is still a mud road and access in the rainy season (November to February) can be problematic. Flying can be the best way to arrive.the pools below them resemble troughs for pounding laundry. The paintings were exe-cuted in red pigments and depict anthropo-morphic and geometric designs as well as fanciful representations of serpents, turtles and other creatures.\nGruta de Umajalanta\nThe R\u00edo Umajalanta, which disappears be-neath a layer of limestone approximately 22m thick, has formed the impressive Uma-jalanta Cavern, of which 4.5km of passages have been explored.\nThe exciting descent is moderately physi-\ncal, and you must expect to get both wet and dirty; there are several parts where you must crawl and wriggle to get through, and a couple of short roped descents. Make sure you have good nonslip shoes on.\nInside are some spectacular stalagmite \nand stalactite formations, as well as a resi-dent population of vampire bats who have produced an impressively large pile of steaming dung over the years.\nYou eventually descend to an under-\nground lake and river, which is populated by small, white, completely blind catfish. The ascent from here is fairly easy, as it takes a more direct route.\nThe 8km one-way walk to the cavern \nentrance takes two hours from the village, with plenty of dinosaur footprints to inspect on the way.\nThere are numerous other caverns in the \narea, many of which are virtually unexplored.\nLlama Chaqui\nA challenging 19km hike around the Cerro Huayllas Orkho from Torotoro will take you to the ruins known as the Llama Chaqui (Foot of the Llama). The multilevel complex, which dates from Inca times, rambles over distinctive terraces and includes a maze of rectangular and semicircular walls, plus a fairly well-preserved watchtower.

The bikes are in good condition and much care is taken.\nSUCRE\npop 215,800 / elevation 2750m\nProud, genteel Sucre is Bolivia\u2019s most beau-tiful city, and the symbolic heart of the nation. It was here that independence was proclaimed, and while La Paz is now the seat of government and treasury, Sucre is recognized in the constitution as the nation\u2019s capital. A glorious ensemble of whitewashed buildings sheltering pretty patios, it\u2019s a spruce place that preserves a wealth of colonial architecture. Sensibly, there are strict controls on development (don\u2019t even think about painting your house black!), which have kept Sucre as a real showpiece of Bolivia. It was declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1991. See p188 for an overview of Sucre\u2019s history.\nSet in a valley surrounded by low moun-\ntains, Sucre enjoys a mild and comfortable climate. It\u2019s still a center of learning, and both the city and its university enjoy reputa-tions as focal points of progressive thought within the country. \nWith a selection of excellent accommo-\ndations, a wealth of churches and museums, and plenty to see and do in the surrounding area, it\u2019s no surprise that visitors end up spending much longer in Sucre than they bargained on.\nOrientation \nSucre is compact and laid out in an eas-ily negotiated grid pattern. Tourist offices give out a good town map and better hotels and tour agencies include maps on the back of their brochures. The Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico \nMilitar  \n(% 645-5514; Arce 172) has topographic \nmaps of Chuquisaca department.\nInformation\nCULTURAL CENTERS\nThere\u2019s a monthly brochure detailing Sucre\u2019s cultural events; look for it at tourist offices or in bars and restaurants.Alliance Fran\u00e7aise\n (% 645-3599; www.afbolivia.org; \nArce 35) French-language library, foreign films and La Taverne restaurant (p220).AIR\nNo air services are scheduled to Torotoro, \nbut you can charter a plane for around B$1000 for up to five passengers one-way. It takes 30 minutes. Call pilot Eugenio Arbinsona  \n(% 422-7042, 424-6289)  for details.\nBUS & CAMI\u00d3N\nBuses (B$25, six hours) depart Cocha bamba \non Wednesday and Saturday at 6:30pm, and Thursday and Sunday at 5:45am from the corner of Avs Rep\u00fablica and 6 de Agosto. They return on Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday at 6am from near the plaza in Torotoro. \nCamiones  ply the same route during the \ndry season, leaving at around the same time. It\u2019s cheap (B$15) but not very comfortable unless you get a seat in the cab (B$20).\nCAR & MOTORCYCLE\nBy far the most comfortable terrestrial way to get to Torotoro is by 4WD or motorbike. Tour agencies (see p209) arrange trans-fers from Cochabamba; the journey takes around five hours.\nYou can rent 4WDs in Cochabamba \n(p201).

Cross one bridge, then take a right turn immediately before a second bridge. About 500m along this road, you need to cut across the riverbed to your left; on the other side, a good cob-blestone road starts and soon reaches the potters\u2019 village of Huaycull\u00ed.

This spectacular road descends into a river valley, and finally makes a precipitous switchback ascent to Torotoro itself.\nMOUNTAIN BICYCLE\nVilla Etelvina (see p209) offers an exciting option to ride a good part of the journey by \n15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   210 15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   210 8/12/09   09:23:21 8/12/09   09:23:21", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3052, "end_char_idx": 4211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2c3ebcc-7561-494c-a7ac-8913819d3ed9": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2c3ebcc-7561-494c-a7ac-8913819d3ed9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7786791a-b223-437a-b4c4-5272946b098a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "4df795a8e6b922ca6aafb16eb1428c01ae1fe32cab94dd08a1922fda6b6dcdcf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b098d057-74f1-4282-b7d9-2c7f139a24ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42f1f1a78854a58d161808227dab85445c42572f9c82eb7b9e443f86b2c040af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comCENTRAL HIGHLANDSCENTRAL HIGHLANDS  \u2022\u2022  Sucre   211\nTOURIST INFORMATION\nIn addition to the following, at the air -\nport and bus terminal there are tourist offices, which are actually often the most useful.Municipal Tourist Office \n(% 643-5240; Argentina \n65) First floor of the Casa de la Cultura; staff can provide \ninformation on the city.\nOficina Universitaria de Turismo  (% 644-7644; \nEstudiantes 49; h 8-11am & 3-5pm Mon-Fri) \nInformation office run by university students, sometimes offering guides for city tours.\nRegional Tourist Office  (% 645-5983; Dalence 1) \nUp the stairs behind the Prefectura building.

The works of Rousseau and Voltaire imbued in the young man notions of progressive liberalism that would shape his entire life and the destiny of a continent.\nBol\u00edvar married a Spaniard in 1802, but she succumbed to yellow fever in Caracas shortly after-\nwards. Although he had many lovers, he could never again marry. The death of his wife marked a drastic shift in Bol\u00edvar\u2019s destiny. He returned to France, where he met with the leaders of the French Revolution and then traveled to the USA to take a close look at the new order after the American Revolution. By the time he returned to Caracas in 1807, he was full of revolutionary theories and experiences taken from these two successful examples. It didn\u2019t take him long to join the clandestine pro-independence circles.\nSpain at the time was in a terrible mess. Napoleon had taken advantage of the weakness of \nCarlos IV, beset by family strife, to put his own brother, a notorious drunkard, on the Spanish throne. In 1808 Spain revolted; French troops were sent in, which started the Guerra de la Inde-pendencia (Peninsular War). Fighting desperately for their own freedom, they were in no state to effectively counter any independence movements on the other side of the Atlantic.\nAt the time, disillusionment with Spanish rule was close to breaking into open revolt. On April \n19, 1810 the Junta Suprema was installed in Caracas, and on July 5, 1811 the Congress declared independence. This turned out to be the beginning of a long and bitter war, most of which was to be orchestrated by Bol\u00edvar.\nHis military career began with the Venezuelan independence movement, of which he soon \ntook command.

Battle followed battle with astonishing frequency until 1824. Of those battles personally directed by Bol\u00edvar, the independence forces won 35, including a few key ones: the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 (August 7, 1819), which secured the independence of Colombia; the Battle of Carabobo (June 24, 1821), which brought freedom to Venezuela; and the Battle of Pichincha (May 24, 1822), which led to the liberation of Ecuador.\nIn September 1822 the Argentine liberator General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, who had occupied \nLima, abandoned the city to the Spanish, and Bol\u00edvar took over the task of winning in Peru. On August 6, 1824 his army was victorious at the Battle of Jun\u00edn, and on December 9, 1824 General \n15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   214 15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   214 8/12/09   09:23:21 8/12/09   09:23:21", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2918, "end_char_idx": 4405, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4409d10a-c5b2-4980-83a9-2ae9a01701cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4409d10a-c5b2-4980-83a9-2ae9a01701cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de00ab60-8209-4c16-bd3d-6310f306259c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "cc1bb9128a357ce192605fed11eb1190594d49cedf5463f8729c12119d08cf30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9bd72ac8-7e90-4e65-96ec-ede565db3fb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c226bd02a22e5c2470281a8d1336e3d617ad401b137437a176197643a59ce3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comCENTRAL HIGHLANDSCENTRAL HIGHLANDS  \u2022\u2022  Sucre   215\nposed prints are increasingly eroded with \nevery passing winter.\nA Dino Bus to the park leaves daily from \nin front of the Cathedral at 9:30am, noon and 2:30pm.

Peru, which included \nAlto Per\u00fa, had been liberated and the war was over. On August 6, 1825, the first anniversary of the Battle of Jun\u00edn, Bolivia declared independence from Peru at Chuquisaca (Sucre), and the new republic was christened \u2018Bolivia,\u2019 after the liberator.\nBut, as Bol\u00edvar well knew, freedom means just that and, although he had grand dreams for \na unified state in the north of South America, they would prove difficult to realize. \u2018I fear peace more than war,\u2019 he wrote perceptively in a letter.\nEstablishing Gran Colombia (which comprised modern-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panam\u00e1 and \nEcuador) was easy, but holding it together as president was impossible for Bol\u00edvar. Clinging stubbornly to his dream of the union, although it was rapidly slipping from his hands, he lost influence, and his glory and charisma faded. He then tried to set up a dictatorship, saying \u2018Our America can only be ruled through a well-managed, shrewd despotism;\u2019 he still saw himself (perhaps correctly) as the best steward of the young nations. After surviving an assassination attempt in Bogot\u00e1, he resigned in 1830, disillusioned, and in poor health. Almost at once, his Gran Colombia dissolved.\nVenezuela seceded in 1830, approved a new congress and banned Bol\u00edvar from his homeland.

There\u2019s a very traditional way of life here, and it\u2019s far removed from the bustle of Sucre or Tarabuco. The community has established a weaving association, which owns a museum  \n(admission B$5)  and textile store that explain \nthe intricate weavings with displays depict -ing their culture rendered in vividly coloured yarns. The store contains a large selec tion of the same high quality weaving found in Sucre but at lower prices, with 100% of the profits going back into the small fair-trade association.\nSome Sucre operators run tours leaving \nfor Candelaria on Saturday, staying the night and proceeding to Tarabuco\u2019s market on Sunday morning. Candelaria Tours (p218) runs a highly recommended one, overnight-ing in a beautiful colonial hacienda. The weaving association can also arrange stays in private homes.\nThere are buses from Sucre to Candelaria \nat 4pm on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

By any standards, it\u2019s pretty touristy, which has meant the inevitable arrival of higher prices and lots of articles from well outside the local area. While there is some very high-quality work here, there\u2019s also a lot of generic stuff, and few bargains to be had. \nOn market days, the Centro Artesanal Inca \nPallay \n(Murillo 25)  sells an array of local weav-\nings and serves meals in its tourist-friendly restaurant. Several places put on exhibi-tions of pujllay  dancing (see below) while \nthe market is on, for a small charge.\nFestivals & Events\nOn March 12, 1816, Tarabuco was the site of the Battle of Jumbati, in which the villagers defended themselves under the leadership of a woman, Do\u00f1a Juana Azurduy de Padilla, and liberated the town from Span-ish forces. In commemoration of the event the village stages Pujllay  (\u2018play\u2019 in Quechua) \non the third Sunday in March, when over 60 surrounding communities turn up in local costume. The celebration begins with a Quechua mass and procession followed by the Pukara  ceremony, a Bolivian version \nof Thanksgiving.

The best place to eat though is at Mallki, just off the plaza, where much better fare is served in an attractive, sunny courtyard.\nGetting There & Away\nThe easiest way to get to Tarabuco is by charter bus (B$35 round-trip, two hours each way) from Sucre, which leaves from \n15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   223 15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   223 8/12/09   09:23:23 8/12/09   09:23:23", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3171, "end_char_idx": 4449, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0acad8e4-0474-475b-a2c9-0a30d89552b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0acad8e4-0474-475b-a2c9-0a30d89552b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1499f5d-29ce-4874-b502-f6fe9881e721", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "b1a5c138815fdbcc1db22d7c0096cc88d4c7642da568aa74b04d807d77a6fd9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d835c627-91d3-4765-9e64-3aec5c49427f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75683c6f9a70bac84f7a05b19f85f9d2cb9a75982f0826d38b3d90f0252fcd8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comCENTRAL HIGHLANDS224   CENTRAL HIGHLANDS  \u2022\u2022  Cordillera de Los Frailes\nMAPS\nThere are numerous walking routes \nthrough the Cordillera de los Frailes, some of which are marked on the 1:50,000 topo sheets Sucre, sheet 6536IV, and Estancia \nChaunaca, sheet 6537III (see p210).\nHiking\nThe best way to see this region is on foot. While hiking between the major villages is easy, a guide is highly recommended to increase your enjoyment of the region and communicate with the Quechua-speaking campesinos . A guide will also help to avoid \nmisunderstandings, minimize your impact and help you get a better feeling for the local culture. It\u2019s easy to find a guide in any of the villages, or you could arrange one from Sucre. From Sucre, if you call the Orientation\nA highly recommended three- or four-day circuit taking in several Cordillera highlights and the villages at the heart of the commu-nity tourism project begins at Chataquila, on the ridge above Punilla, 25km northwest of Sucre. From here (with an optional side trip to the abstract red, white and black man-animal rock paintings at Incamachay and Pumamachay) you descend to Chaunaca, then head to the Cr\u00e1ter de Maragua, before heading up to the village of Potolo, from where there\u2019s daily transportation back to Sucre. (For more on these places, see Hiking, below.) You can do this circuit just on foot or combine hiking and public transportation. It\u2019s also a very enjoyable region to explore by bike \u2013 you can rent one in Sucre (p222).THE JALQ\u2019A COMMUNITIES\nThe Cordillera de los Frailes is the home of the Quechua-speaking Jalq\u2019a people, of whom there are \nsome 10,000 in the area around Potolo and Maragua. They have traditionally made a living from farming potatoes, wheat and barley, and herding sheep and goats. The weaving of elaborately patterned aqsus (an apron-like skirt) is an important craft tradition, and these Escher-like red-\nand-black garments are instantly recognizable, being patterned with inventive depictions of khurus \u2013 strange, demon-like figures.\nIn 2001 the Jalq\u2019a decided that they wanted to embrace tourism, but in a sustainable form \nthat would benefit the community without destroying its traditions. They have developed a se-ries of accommodations, cultural centers and guiding services, all involving maximal community participation. The villages receive 100% of profits.\nTo date, tailored accommodations and restaurant services have been set up in the villages of \nMaragua and Potolo. Sets of attractive thatched caba\u00f1as have been constructed using traditional \nmethods and materials; they boast comfortable beds, hot water and attractive wooden furniture, and are decorated with local textiles. These cost B$60 per person per night; for B$100 per person, meals and cultural displays are included. The villages also have good camping areas. In Chaunaca, there\u2019s also a camping area, and six beds set up in the information center, but no restaurant service.\nThese are well-placed for a three-day circuit of the area, starting in Chataquila, heading to \nthe rock paintings, and sleeping in Chaunaca. The next day you could head to Maragua (three hours), from where it\u2019s a spectacular six- to seven-hour walk \u2013 via chullpa (funerary towers) and with a short diversion to see the dinosaur footprints at Ni\u00f1u Mayu \u2013 to Potolo.\nOn the way, you will eat traditional Bolivian campesino meals \u2013 such as kala purca, a maize \nsoup cooked by immersing hot stones in it. Cultural activities that can be organized include demonstrations of pujllay dancing or traditional medicine. Weaving workshops can be found in all the villages mentioned, as well as some others, while Chaunaca has an interpretation center, and Potolo a museum of indigenous healing. Maragua has an agricultural museum in the pipeline. Note that the Jalq\u2019a aren\u2019t fond of being photographed.\nYou can reach the area independently and organize guides, or take a pre-organized tour from \nSucre. While many agencies offer day-trips to villages in the area, a longer trip that gives more back to the locals is recommended.

It\u2019s one of the most visually strik-ing places in Bolivia. There\u2019s plenty to see: waterfalls, caves and a picturesque cemetery in the middle of the crater that dates from pre-Hispanic times.\nThe village of Maragua  is an active weaving \ncentre. The weavers have set up a store, and will take visitors into their homes to show them the creation of the textiles. Maragua has a store, three caba\u00f1as  (see boxed text, \np224) and a campsite.

At the first major curve on the road west of Chataquila, a rugged track heads north along the ridge.

In recent times some visitors have reported an unpleasant reception by villagers and it is strongly rec-ommended that you check the current situ-ation before setting out, and go with a guide.\nTours\nSeveral Sucre travel agencies (see p218) offer quick jaunts into the Cordillera \u2013 for exam-ple, a two-day circuit from Chataquila to Incamachay and Chaunaca. It\u2019s important to go with a responsible operator commit-ted to giving something to the region \u2013 day-trips aren\u2019t a great idea.

This quote, from the city\u2019s first coat of arms, sums it up. The city was founded in 1545 as soon as the ore was discovered, and pretty soon the silver extracted here was bankrolling the Spanish empire.\nPotos\u00ed\u2019s story is wholly tied to its silver. \nDuring the boom years, when the metal must have seemed inexhaustible, it became the largest and wealthiest city of the Ameri-cas. Even today, something very lucrative is visited if you are prepared to add an extra hour or so to your hike. All of these can be found most easily with a local guide. Ask around in the villages and negotiate a price that is fair to the community.\nAnother side trip from Humaca could \ntake you to the Termas de Talula , 5km away. \nYou\u2019ll need to ford the R\u00edo Pilcomayo twice. The Talula hot springs issue into rock pools that have temperatures up to 46\u00b0C. Camp-ing is possible anywhere in the vicinity.\nFrom Talula it\u2019s 500m to the constricted \npassage that conducts the R\u00edo Pilcomayo be-tween the steep walls of the Punkurani gorge. When the river is low, you can cross over to the Potos\u00ed shore and see the many rock-painting sites above the opposite bank.\nPOTOLO\nThe village of Potolo , end point of the \nhike, has some typically stunning weaving going on in the workshops, and also has a museum of traditional medicine, which demonstrates vernacular healing practices and other aspects of the culture. There are three caba\u00f1as  here (see boxed text, p224), \na store and a campsite. \nInfrequent buses from Sucre via Chata-\nquila and Chaunaca leave from Yuraj Yuraj, the roundabout on the ro ad out of the city \ntowards the airport.

It begins in 1544 when a \nlocal Inca, Diego Huallpa, searching for an escaped llama, stopped to build a fire at the foot of the mountain known in Quechua as \u2018Potojsi\u2019 (meaning \u2018thunder\u2019 or \u2018explosion,\u2019 although it might also have stemmed from potoj,  \u2018the springs\u2019). The fire grew so hot \nthat the very earth beneath it started to melt, and shiny liquid oozed from the ground.\nDiego immediately realized he had run \nacross a commodity for which the Spanish conquerors had an insatiable appetite. Perhaps he also remembered the Inca legend associated with the mountain, in which Inca Huayna Capac had been in-structed by a booming voice not to dig in the hill of Potojsi, but to leave the metal alone, because it was intended for others.\nWhatever the truth of this, the Spanish \neventually learned of the enormous wealth buried in the mountain of Potojsi and determined that it warranted immediate attention. On April 1 (according to some sources, April 10), 1545, the Villa Imperial de Carlos V was founded at the foot of Cerro Rico and large-scale excavation began. In the time it takes to say \u2018Get down there and said to vale un Potos\u00ed  (be worth a Potos\u00ed). \nThen, once the silver more or less dried up, decline and poverty were the hard facts. The ore has been extracted by miners in some of the most abysmal conditions imaginable \u2013 a visit to see today\u2019s miners at work provokes disbelief at just how appalling the job is. But the rest of Potos\u00ed \u2013 its grand churches, ornate colonial architecture and down-to-earth, friendly inhabitants \u2013 is a real delight.\nHistory\nNo one is certain how much silver has been extracted from Cerro Rico over its four centuries of productivity, but a popular boast was that the Spanish could have con-structed a silver bridge to Spain and still had silver left to carry across it. The Spanish monarchy, mortgaged to the hilt by foreign bankers, came to rely completely on the yearly treasure fleets, which brought the Potos\u00ed silver. On the rare occasions when they were intercepted by storms or pirates, it was a national disaster.\nAlthough the tale of Potos\u00ed\u2019s origins \nprobably takes a few liberties with the facts, \n15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   229 15-central-highlands-bol7.indd   229 8/12/09   09:23:24 8/12/09   09:23:24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2353, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8c9dd16-bc60-42d4-bd26-7ee4217badce": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8c9dd16-bc60-42d4-bd26-7ee4217badce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3706517-a39c-48a6-bb04-768d829a3ec9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "c75e797f532b10d4e83a17ba954d8fedc9cf422323edc64c63ddaa595c9c9252", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c48ff21-bbc7-44e7-acb4-2bb68815258b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42d135ed15c0eddb686c12a3288f0f513ede7e68170229827878ad43e8e1457e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comCENTRAL HIGHLANDS230    CENTRAL HIGHLANDS  \u2022\u2022  Potos\u00ed\nextraction continues only on a small scale, \nbut reminders of the city\u2019s grand colonial past are still evident.\nMost of the operations in Cerro Rico \ntoday are in the control of miner-owned cooperatives, which operate under con-ditions that have changed shamefully lit-tle from the colonial period.

The descendants of the very few to survive mainly live in the Yungas (see boxed text, p131).\nIn order to increase productivity, the \nViceroy of Toledo instituted, in 1572, the Ley de la Mita, which required all indigen-ous and African slaves over age 18 to work in shifts of 12 hours. They would remain underground without seeing daylight for four months at a time, eating, sleeping and working in the mines. When they emerged from a \u2018shift,\u2019 their eyes were covered to prevent damage in the bright sunlight.\nNaturally these miners, who came to be \nknown as mitayos,  didn\u2019t last long. Heavy \nlosses were also incurred among those who worked in the ingenios  (smelting mills), as \nthe silver-smelting process involved contact with deadly mercury. In all, it\u2019s estimated that over the three centuries of colonial rule (1545 to 1825) as many as eight million Africans and indigenous Bolivians died from the appalling conditions.\nIn 1672 a mint was established to coin \nthe silver, reservoirs were constructed to provide water for the growing population, and exotic European consumer goods found their way up the llama trails from Arica and Callao.

These were formerly used to extract silver from the ore hauled out of Cerro Rico. There were originally 82 ingenios  \nalong 15km of the stream. Some remaining ones date back to the 1570s and were in use until the mid-1800s.\nEach ingenio  consists of a floor pene-\ntrated by shallow wells (buitrones)  where \nthe ore was mixed with mercury and salt. The ore was then ground by millstones that were powered by water that was impounded in the 32 artificial Lagunas de Kari Kari (p241).\nThe Ingenio San Marcos  \n(San Marcos Smelter; La \nPaz near Periodista)  is the most interesting and \nhas a good restaurant  (La Paz 1565; www.hca-potosi\n.com/sanmarcos). Most tours of the Cerro Rico \nmines include a stop at a working ingenio  \nas part of the trip.\nCOOPERATIVE MINES\nA visit to the cooperative mines will al-most surely be one of the most memorable experiences you\u2019ll have in Bolivia, provid-ing an opportunity to witness working con-ditions that are among the most grueling imaginable. We urge you not to under-estimate the dangers involved in going into the mines and to consider the voyeuristic factor involved in seeing other people\u2019s suffering. You may be left stunned and/or ill (see boxed text, p235).\nDozens of Potos\u00ed operators (p235) offer \nguided tours through the mines. The best tour guides tend to be ex-miners, who know the conditions and are friendly with the men at work. The safety standards are hit-and-miss; you really are going down at your own risk.\nMine visits aren\u2019t easy, and the low ceil-\nings and steep, muddy passageways are best visited in your worst clothes. You\u2019ll feel both cold and hot at times, there will likely be a bit of crawling through narrow shafts and the altitude can be extremely tax-ing. On some tours, you\u2019ll end up walking 3km or 4km inside the mountain. You\u2019ll be exposed to noxious chemicals and gases, including silica dust (the cause of silicosis), arsenic gas and acetylene vapors, as well as asbestos deposits. Anyone with doubts or medical problems should avoid these tours. The plus side is that you can speak with the friendly miners, who will share their La Capilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Jerusal\u00e9n  is a \nlittle-known Potos\u00ed gem.

There\u2019s often a dem-onstration of a dynamite explosion; the force is like a hammer blow to the chest even at some distance. This can be potentially dangerous and is detrimental to the environ-ment so we urge you to request a tour with-out dynamite explosion when signing up.\nTours run in the morning or afternoon \nand last from four to five hours. The standard insights and opinions about their difficult lot. The miners are proud of their work in such tough conditions, and generally happy for visitors to observe their toil.\nTours begin with a visit to the miners\u2019 \nmarket, where miners stock up on acetylene rocks, dynamite, cigarettes and other essen-tials. In the past, gifts weren\u2019t expected, but with the growing number of tourists, you\u2019d be very unpopular if you didn\u2019t supply a handful of coca leaves and a few cigarettes \u2013 luxuries for which the miners\u2019 meager earn-\nTHE JOB FROM HELL\nIn the cooperative mines on Cerro Rico, all work is done with mostly primitive tools, and under-\nground temperatures vary from below freezing \u2013 the altitude is over 4200m \u2013 to a stifling 115\u00b0F on the 4\nth and 5th levels. Miners, exposed to all sorts of noxious chemicals and gases, normally \ndie of silicosis pneumonia within 10 to 15 years of entering the mines.\nWomen are admitted to many cooperative mines but only five are allowed to be in the mine\u2019s \ninterior at any one time. That\u2019s because quite a few miners hang on to the tradition that women underground invite bad luck, and in many cases, the taboo applies only to miners\u2019 wives, whose presence in the mines would invite jealousy from Pachamama. At any rate, lots of Quechua women are consigned to stay right outside the mines picking through the tailings, gleaning small amounts of minerals that may have been missed.\nSince cooperative mines are owned by the miners themselves, they must produce to make \ntheir meager living. The majority of the work is done by hand with explosives and tools they must purchase themselves, including the acetylene lamps used to detect pockets of deadly carbon monoxide gas.\nMiners prepare for their workday by socializing and chewing coca for several hours, begin-\nning work at about 10am. They work until lunch at 2pm, when they rest and chew more coca. For those who don\u2019t spend the night working, the day usually ends at 7pm. On the weekend, each miner (or a group of miners) sells his week\u2019s production to the buyer for as high a price as he can negotiate.\nWhen miners first enter the mine, they offer propitiation at the shrine of the miners\u2019 god Tata \nKaj\u2019chu, whom they hope will afford them protection in the harsh underground world. Deeper in the mine, visitors will undoubtedly see a devilish figure occupying a small niche somewhere along the passageways. As most of the miners believe in a god in heaven, they deduce that there must also be a devil beneath the earth in a place where it\u2019s hot and uncomfortable. Since hell (according to the traditional description of the place) must not be far from the environment in which they work, they reason that the devil himself must own the minerals they\u2019re dynamiting and digging out of the earth. In order to appease this character, whom they call T\u00edo (Uncle) or Supay \u2013 never Diablo \u2013 they set up a little ceramic figurine in a place of honor.\nOn Friday nights a cha\u2019lla  (offering) is made to invoke his goodwill and protection. A little \nalcohol is poured on the ground before the statue, lighted cigarettes are placed in his mouth and coca leaves are laid out within easy reach. Then, as in most Bolivian celebrations, the miners smoke, chew coca and proceed to drink themselves unconscious.

Anyone planning to take a tour needs to realize that there are risks involved (see p234). People with medical problems \u2013 especially claustrophobia, asthma and other respiratory conditions \u2013 should avoid these tours. While medical experts including the NHS note that limited exposure from a few hours\u2019 tour is extremely unlikely to cause any lasting health impacts, if you have any concerns whatsoever about exposure to asbestos or silica dust, you should not enter the mines. Accidents can also happen \u2013 explosions, falling rocks, runaway trolleys, etc. For these reasons, all tour companies make visitors sign a disclaimer absolving them completely from any responsibility for injury, illness or death \u2013 if your tour operator does not, choose another.

This bizarre practice lies deeply rooted in indigenous tradition and is thus often misunderstood by outsiders, who can make little sense of the violent and often grisly spectacle.\nTinku  may be best interpreted as a type of ritualized means of discharging tensions \nbetween different indigenous communities. Fights between campesinos  are very rare in \nthese communities in daily life. Festivities begin with singing and dancing, but participants eventually drink themselves into a stupor. As a result, celebrations may well erupt into drunken mayhem and frequently violence, as alcohol-charged emotions are unleashed in hostile encounters.\nA tinku  usually lasts two or three days, when men and women in brightly colored traditional \ndress hike in from surrounding communities. The hats worn by the men strongly resemble those originally worn by the Spanish conquistadores, but are topped, Robin Hood style, with one long, fluorescent feather.\nOn the first evening, the communities parade through town to the accompaniment of \ncharangos  and zampo\u00f1as  (a type of pan pipe). Periodically, the revelers halt and form two con-\ncentric circles, with women on the inside and the men in the outer circle. The women begin singing a typically repetitious and cacophonous chant while the men run in a circle around them. Suddenly, everyone stops and launches into a powerful stomping dance. Each group is headed by at least one person \u2013 usually a man \u2013 who uses a whip to urge on any man whom he perceives isn\u2019t keeping up with the rhythm and the pace.\nThis routine may seem harmless enough, except that alcohol plays a significant and controlling \nrole. Most people carry bottles filled with puro  (rubbing alcohol), which is the drink of choice, \nif the intent is to quickly become totally plastered. By nightfall, each participating community retreats to a designated house to drink chicha  until they pass out.\nThis excessive imbibing inevitably results in social disorder, and by the second day the drunk \nparticipants tend to grow increasingly aggressive. As they roam the streets, they encounter people from other communities with whom they may have some quarrel, either real or imagined. Common complaints include anything from land disputes to extramarital affairs to the theft of farm animals, and may well result in a challenge to fight.\nThe situation rapidly progresses past yelling and cursing to pushing and shoving, before it \nturns into rather mystical \u2013 almost choreographed \u2013 warfare. Seemingly rhythmically, men strike each other\u2019s heads and upper bodies with extended arms (in fact, this has been immortalized in the tinku  dance, which is frequently performed during Carnaval entradas  \u2013 entrance processions \n\u2013 especially in highly traditional Oruro). To augment the hand-to-hand combat, the fighters may also throw rocks at their opponents, occasionally causing serious injury or death. Any fatalities, however, are resignedly considered a blood offering to Pachamama in lieu of a llama sacrifice for the same purpose.\nThe best known and arguably most violent tinku  takes place in the village of Macha during \nthe first couple of weeks of May, while the villages of Ocur\u00ed and Toracar\u00ed, among others, also host tinkus .\nAs you\u2019d imagine, few foreigners aspire to witness this private and often violent tradition,  \nwhich categoricallly cannot be thought of as a tourist attraction, and many people who have attended insist they\u2019d never do it again.

The references to the region\u2019s resemblance to the south of Spain were started by Tarija\u2019s founder, Luis de Fuentes, who was seemingly anxious to lend a bit of home to a foreign land. He thus named the river flowing past the city of Tarija the Guadalquivir (after Andaluc\u00eda\u2019s biggest river), and left the \nchapacos  \u2013 as tarije\u00f1os  (Tarija \nlocals) are otherwise known \u2013 with a lilting dialect of European Spanish.\nTarija\u2019s far eastern regions are full of petroleum-rich scrublands, backed by stark high-\nlands and surrounded by the red earth of the Gran Chaco.

Bolivia was widely seen as the aggressor in diplomatic circles and its case generated little support. The hot, dry climate made access to fresh water a decisive factor in the war, with capturing and keeping access to wells a key strategy. Conditions were miserable, soldiers were ill-equipped and disease was rife, and as a result casualties on both sides were heavy. \nAs the war progressed the Bolivians were \ndriven back beyond their current borders, though they continued to fight, with their most successful battle in the town of Villa-montes in 1934. Though no decisive victory was reached in the war, both nations had grown weary of fighting and peace nego-tiations held four years later awarded most of the disputed territory to Paraguay. To History\nPrior to the 1932\u201335 Chaco War, Bolivia had long claimed rights to the Chaco, an inhospitable region beneath which rich oil-fields were mooted to lie. The disputed area of about 240,680 sq km stretched northeast of the Paraguay and Pilcomayo Rivers in Paraguay, and included the 168,765-sq-km chunk of Argentina north of the R\u00edo Bermejo. With political turmoil in Paraguay causing a distraction, and economic hard-ship in Bolivia providing a stimulus, the Bolivians saw their opportunity and began to slowly advance into Paraguayan territory.\nAfter losing the War of the Pacific in \n1884, Bolivia was desperate to have the Chaco as an outlet to the Atlantic via the R\u00edo Paraguay. Hoping that physical pos-session would be interpreted as official sov-ereignty, the Bolivian army set up a fort at Piquirenda on the R\u00edo Pilcomayo. Bolivia then refused to relinquish rights to Fuerte Vanguardia, its only port on the Paraguay river (and not in Bolivian territory). In 1928 Paraguay responded by sending its army to seize the fort, and although things got \n16-south-central-bol-bol7.indd   244 16-south-central-bol-bol7.indd   244 8/12/09   09:28:43 8/12/09   09:28:43", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2353, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e42261ed-9237-4205-924f-8628b6a22d66": {"__data__": {"id_": "e42261ed-9237-4205-924f-8628b6a22d66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "245", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da6745b6-e6e0-4054-afa0-c418065af5d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "245", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "896e68b9b447228dce0459b96844432d2dfc8329bff6e5a77bfc8c1afdb88e80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc534629-645c-44c2-8c59-3b6e20b933a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0393f3f7f36087616b6b4f5564684a2324656274ee41e1fb3dcd51ab6a2ebca3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comSOUTH CENTRAL BOLIVIA\n& THE CHACOSOUTH CENTRAL BOLIVIA  \u2022\u2022  Tarija   245\nDespite the fact that the Bolivians from \nbigger cities regard South Central Bolivia as a half-civilized backwater, and that \u2018chapaco\u2019  is the butt of tasteless jokes told \nin La Paz, Tarija is a pleasant place to stop off on your way to Argentina.\nTARIJA\npop 132,000 / elevation 1905m\nThis little city is as laid-back as they get, with palm-lined squares, sizzling Argentine barbecues, sprawling bar and cafe terraces, and tight streets with narrow pavements.

If you have time, go around some of the surrounding winer-ies and try the Bolivian vino  or the throat-\nheating singani  (distilled grape spirit). \nHistory\nTarija was founded as La Villa de San \nBernardo de Tarixa, by Don Luis de Fuentes y Vargas on July 4, 1574, under the orders of Viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo. In 1810 the region declared independence from Spanish rule. Although the breakaways weren\u2019t taken seriously by the Spanish, the situation did erupt into armed warfare on April 15, 1817. At the Batalla de la Tablada, the chapacos  won a major victory over the \nSpanish forces. In the early 19th century, Tarija actively supported Bolivia\u2019s strug-gle for independence. Although Argentina wanted to annex the agriculturally favorable area, Tarija opted to join the Bolivian Republic when it was established in 1825.\nOrientation\nStreet numbers are preceded by an O ( oeste  \u2013 \nwest) for those addresses west of Calle Col\u00f3n and an E ( este \u2013 east) for those east \nof Col\u00f3n; addresses north of Av Victor Paz Estenssoro (Av Las Am\u00e9ricas) take an N.\nInformation\nBetween 1pm and 4pm Tarija becomes a virtual ghost town.

The dry season in the region lasts from April to November.\nNational Parks & Reserves\nRemote, wild and off the beaten track, South Central Bolivia\u2019s parks and reserves are perfect for hardcore adventure seekers. Infrastructure is almost nonexistent, but a visit to any of the reserves will make a lasting impression.

Perhaps the most worthwhile relic is the funola,  an early \ntype of player piano that produced music by forcing air through a strip of perforated paper. The building now belongs to the uni-versity and houses the Casa de la Cultura.

Rodeo Chapaco  (April 15-21) \nincludes all the standard cowboy events. Take micro C  from the center.\nAUGUST\nTarija\u2019s well-known Fiesta de San Roque  \n(August 16) gives thanks to the saint whose appearance supposedly marked the end of the plague and leprosy in the area. The main celebration, however, doesn\u2019t begin until the first Sunday of September and then con-tinues for eight days. It features tra ditional musical performances and a colorful Chuncho (an indigenous tribe) procession in which the participants wear \u2018cover-all\u2019 clothes traditionally worn by lepers. A statue of the saint is carried, his clothes being changed daily during the festival, and believers line the streets asking him to cure their family\u2019s ills.\nOCTOBER\nThe annual Fiesta de las Flores  (2nd Sunday \nin October) is a religious celebration dedi-cated to the Virgin of Rosario. It begins with a procession, which sets off from the Iglesia de San Juan. Along the route, spec-tators shower participants with petals. The highlight of the day is a colorful fair and bazaar in which the faithful spend lavishly for the benefit of the Church.\nAsk around about the arts fair  in October \nand about the  Serrano Ham & Cheese Festival .CHURCHES\nArchitecturally, Tarija\u2019s most unusual \nchurch and major landmark is the bright, white 1887 Iglesia de San Roque . Dedicated to \nthe city\u2019s patron saint, the church sits on the hill at the end of General Bernardo Trigo, lording it over the town. Its balcony once served as a lookout post.\nThe rather dull-looking cathedral  \n(cnr \nCampero & La Madrid) contains the remains of \nprominent chapacos,  including Tarija\u2019s \nfounder, Don Luis de Fuentes y Vargas. It was constructed in 1611 and has some interest-ing stained glass depicting harvest scenes. \nThe Bas\u00edlica de San Francisco  \n(cnr Campos & La \nMadrid)  was founded in 1606 and is now a \nnational monument. The 16th-century convent library and archives, which may conjure up images from The Name of the \nRose,  can be used only by researchers \nwho have been granted permission by the Franciscan order. Inside the basilica, the free Museo Franciscano Frey Francisco Miguel \nMari \n(h 8am-6pm Mon-Fri) displays ecumenical \npaintings, sculptures and artifacts.\nThe Iglesia de San Juan,  at the top of \nBol\u00edvar, was constructed in 1632. Here the Spanish signed their surrender to the liberation army after the Batalla de la Tablada. The garden serves as a mirador  \n(lookout) of Tarija and its dramatic back-drop of brown mountains.\nMIRADOR LOMA DE SAN JUAN\nThis park area above the tree-covered slopes of the Loma de San Juan  provides a grand \ncity view and is a favorite with smooching students.

HOW TO P ARTY CHAP ACO-STYLE\nTarija is Bolivia\u2019s music and dance region, famous for its unique traditions and loud, colorful \nfestivals, especially during Carnaval, when all chapacos  (Tarija locals) come out to dance, sing and \nparty the days away. If you find yourself in the region during a fiesta, here\u2019s what to expect.\nThe folk music of Tarija features unusual woodwind instruments, such as the erque  and quenilla,  \nthe ca\u00f1a  and the camache\u00f1a . The song that accompanies the music is called a copla  \u2013 a direct \nimport from Spain \u2013 with comic verses, sung in a duet, and the dance that tops it all off is the traditional Chuncho. Dancers wear colorful outfits, feathered headgear and masks, symbolizing the Chiriguano tribes and their long-term resistance of the conquerors. \nTarija\u2019s Carnaval  is one of the most animated in Bolivia and brilliant fun. To launch the fes-\ntivities, two Thursdays before Carnaval, Tarija celebrates the Fiesta de Compadres . This unique \nfiesta, celebrated the following Thursday, is Tarija\u2019s largest pre-Carnaval festival.

This unique \nfiesta, celebrated the following Thursday, is Tarija\u2019s largest pre-Carnaval festival. It\u2019s assumed that the celebration, originating in the village of Pola de Siero, in the northern Spanish region of Asturias, was inspired by the wives of Spanish colonial authorities and soldiers, who saw to it that social customs and morals were strictly followed. It was eventually adopted by the local indigenous population and is now celebrated by the entire community with music, dancing and special basket tableaux constructed of bread known as bollus pre\u00f1aus . There are flowers, fruits, \ntubers, small cakes and other gifts, all passed between female friends and relatives.\nThroughout the Carnaval season, the streets fill with dancing, original chapaco  (local Tarijan) \nmusic and colorfully costumed country folk who turn up in town for the event. There\u2019s a Grand Ball in the main plaza after the celebration and the entire town comes out for the dancing and performances by folkloric groups, bands and orchestras. Beware: water balloons figure prominently in the festivities.\nOn the Sunday after Carnaval, the barrio near the cemetery enacts a \u2018funeral\u2019 in which the \ndevil is burned and buried in preparation for Lent. Paid mourners lend the ritual a morose air \u2013 although we suspect they\u2019re actually lamenting that they must remain vice free for the 40 days until Easter.\n16-south-central-bol-bol7.indd   249 16-south-central-bol-bol7.indd   249 8/12/09   09:28:44 8/12/09   09:28:44", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2828, "end_char_idx": 4649, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cacd841b-4286-4242-ba51-08cea7a29739": {"__data__": {"id_": "cacd841b-4286-4242-ba51-08cea7a29739", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "250", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6635adc-d8bc-48d0-b13e-5300b4159478", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "250", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "ae8d0ef24952b266a41a7fccea46fb9a6c1752988cb79a93abd663a95469b733", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fab628a7-00ae-4482-876a-232d4bb25a07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8111cc6e699339f2ee522f300ebc8ea58ed33bcb217d8d4db044b51c91cfb28e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SOUTH CENTRAL BOLIVIA\n& THE CHACOBook your stay at lonelyplanet.com/hotels 250    SOUTH CENTRAL BOLIVIA  \u2022\u2022  Tarija\na clue to their meat-based menu, but this \nplace also injects a portion of creativity into its dishes that takes it beyond the realm of the \u2018ordinary churrasquer\u00eda \u2019.

The grapevines, first brought \nto the region by 17th-century missionaries, grow at a staggering 1900m and 2100m and are only 22 degrees south of the equator. They ripen quicker than their sea-level cousins and the wine is given a head start in the maturing process, making rich reserves easier to produce. The grapes grown here are a mix of Muscat of Alexandria and Californian, but with a taste all their own.\nMost bodegas also produce singani,  a distilled grape spirit (40%) of varying quality. Mi Socio,  \nthe cheapest and harshest, is marked by a blue-label; the red-label Special de Oro  is of medium \nprice and quality; the best, Coleci\u00f3n Privada,  a flowery, fresh, fragrant spirit, has a black label. The \ncheaper types are usually drunk mixed with soda and lemon. Bodega La Concepci\u00f3n produces the region\u2019s best singani .\nTo visit the wineries and sample the wines, inquire at the individual offices in Tarija. All offices \nsell bottles at factory prices (B$15 to B$100). Taxis to Concepci\u00f3n leave when full (B$5, 20 minutes) from the corner of Corrado and Trigo.

In the highland portion of the reserve (3400m above sea level), one can visit the Tajzara lakes, an important site for aquatic birds. Temperatures in the highlands stay quite chilly year-round but are slightly more comfortable in the drier winter months (May to August). The best time to visit the lower elevations is in the summer, when it\u2019s warm enough to swim.\nThe reserve is jointly administered by \nServicio Nacional de \u00c1reas Protegidas \n(SERNAP; Map \npp68-9; see pp62-3) in La Paz and Prometa  (Map \np246; % 663-3873; www.elgranchaco.com/prometa; Carpio \nE-659, Tarija) . Check their website or the Tarija \noffice for latest ecotouristic developments.\nTajzara Section\nThe area known as Tajzara lies high on the cold and windy puna  (high open grass-\nlands) of western Tarija department. Here, several shallow flamingo-filled lagoons appear like jewels in the harsh Altiplano, vegetated only by thola  (a small desert \nbush of the Altiplano) and paja brava  \n(spiky grass of the high Altiplano). Tarija\u2019s New Agers consider Tajzara to be a natural power site whilst the locals claim that the lakes are haunted by nocturnal spirit voices, and woe betide anybody that stays out after dark. The night air does produce some eerie voice-like cries, but unimaginative people ascribe the phenomenon to winds rushing through the thola .\nAlong the eastern shores of the lagoons, \nthe wind has heaped up large arenales  (sand \ndunes). An interesting climb takes you to the symmetrical peak of Muyuloma , which rises \nabout 1000m above the plain. The summit affords views across the lagoons and beyond to the endless expanses of the southern Altiplano. The return climb takes the better part of a day.\nNear the Tajzara visitors\u2019 center, Pro-\nmeta has an albergue  \n(r per person under/over 25 M\u00e9ndez family chapel and remains in \nprivate ownership. Just to the north is the former home of Jaime Paz Zamora , with an \nadjacent billboard paying homage to the ex-president.\nMicros  and trufis  (B$3, 30 minutes) \nleave from the corner of Domingo Paz and Saracho in Tarija approximately every 20 minutes during the day.\nEL VALLE DE LA CONCEPCI\u00d3N\nThe Concepci\u00f3n Valley, or simply \u2018El Valle,\u2019 is the heart of Bolivian wine (see the boxed text p253) and singani  production.

The name of the park comes from Guaran\u00ed, meaning \u2018the lair of the jaguar,\u2019 because the range is famous for being home to this lovely, spotty (and scary) cat. Foxes, tapir, anteater, assorted parrots, numerous plant species and 70% of the region\u2019s potable water sources can also be found here.

Support for President Morales is thin on the ground here and cruce\u00f1os voiced \ntheir overwhelming desire for the region\u2019s autonomy in 2006. Though they lost that battle following a national referendum, calls for independence continue to be the main source of inspiration for the city\u2019s graffiti artists and the matter is far from settled.\nIt\u2019s worth spending a few days here, \nwandering the streets, eating at the many international restaurants and checking out the rich kids\u2019 play area, Equipetrol, where nightlife is rife with naughtiness. Alterna-tively, simply chill out at the town square. \nHistory\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra was founded in 1561 by \u00d1uflo de Chavez, a Spaniard who hailed from present-day Paraguay. The town orig-inated 220km east of its current location, but in 1621, by order of the King of Spain, it moved to its present position, 50km east of the Cordillera Oriental foothills. The original location had proved too vulnerable to attack from local tribes. \u00d1uflo himself was killed in 1568 at the hands of the mestizo Itatine tribe made up of indigenous and Spanish settlers.\nThe city\u2019s main aim was to supply the \nrest of the colony with products such as rice, cotton, sugar and fruit. Its prosperity lasted until the late 1800s, when transporta-tion routes opened up between La Paz and the Peruvian coast, making imported goods cheaper than those hauled from Santa Cruz over mule trails.\nDuring the period leading up to Bolivia\u2019s \nindependence in 1825, the eastern regions of the Spanish colonies were largely ignored. Although agriculture was thriving around Santa Cruz, the Spanish remained intent upon extracting every scrap of mineral wealth that could be squeezed from the rich and more hospitable highlands.Climate\nThe Oriente\u2019s climate is tropical, but because it occupies the transition zone between the Amazon rainforest, the highlands and the dry Chaco plains, Santa Cruz enjoys more sun and less stifling temperatures than the humid Amazon Basin. Winter rainfalls mean little more than 10-minute downpours, but a single summer deluge can last for days. At times during winter,  surazos  (chilly winds) \nblow in from Patagonia and the Argentine pampas and the temperature plummets. \nNational Parks\nParque Nacional Ambor\u00f3 (p276) is an unquestionable highlight of the region. The remote Parque Nacional Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco is Latin America\u2019s largest park but is largely inaccessible.\nGetting There & Away\nSanta Cruz is the country\u2019s most connected city. Many flights from Europe and neigh-boring countries come direct to Santa Cruz and are worth considering if you\u2019re arriv-ing from sea level and don\u2019t want to spend days acclimatizing in La Paz. Direct flights depart daily for Buenos Aires, Miami, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\nTrains trundle south to Argentina and \neast to the Brazilian Pantanal, and there are long-distance buses running along paved roads to the west and south, as well as frequent domestic flights.\nSANTA CRUZ\npop 1.54 million / elevation 417m\nSanta Cruz may surprise you with its small-town feeling, lack of high-rise blocks and a lightly buzzing, relaxed tropical atmos-phere.

Locals still lounge on the main square listening to camba  (Eastern Lowlands) music, res-\ntaurants close for siesta and little stores line the porch-fronted houses selling cheap local products. \nThis is not the Bolivia that you see in \npictures, but this is the place with the largest population diversity in the country \u2013 from \n17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   263 17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   263 8/12/09   09:31:54 8/12/09   09:31:54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3314, "end_char_idx": 4428, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0280082e-1daf-4e2a-bc6b-c9ad10fe2e6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0280082e-1daf-4e2a-bc6b-c9ad10fe2e6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02c5cf26-44a7-4c8a-92a6-060b37f820dc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "288aec77b470bdb558aa57f4e23574ecfc2e2748b7f25ba17c5bce6d8ab62f83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comSANTA CRUZ &\nGRAN CHIQUITANIA264    SANTA CRUZ & GRAN CHIQUITANIA  \u2022\u2022  Santa Cruz\n17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   264 17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   264 8/12/09   09:31:55 8/12/09   09:31:55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 213, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3500c204-c767-4854-aba3-2710c337b280": {"__data__": {"id_": "3500c204-c767-4854-aba3-2710c337b280", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbb998db-56c0-4fcc-a7f9-8005db5c3e2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "561ffe812c4c5f187994c3f63616383d7f08d11b398c4fc2e49864fb110c6df0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comSANTA CRUZ &\nGRAN CHIQUITANIASANTA CRUZ & GRAN CHIQUITANIA  \u2022\u2022  Santa Cruz   265\nIn 1954 a highway linking Santa Cruz \nwith other major centers was completed, and the city sprang back from its 100-year economic lull. The completion of the rail-way line to Brazil in the mid-1950s opened trade routes to the east, after which time tropical agriculture boomed and the city grew as prosperously as crops such as oranges, sugar cane, bananas and coffee. It has continued to grow to the present day.\nOrientation\nRoughly oval in shape, Santa Cruz is laid out in anillos  (rings), which form concentric \ncircles around the city center, and radiales  \n(spokes) that connect the rings. Radial 1, the road to Viru-Viru airport, runs roughly north\u2013south; the radiales  progress clock-\nwise up to Radial 27.\nMost commercial enterprises, hotels \nand restaurants lie within the primer  (first) \nanillo,  which is centered on the Plaza 24 de \nSeptiembre. The street of the same name becomes Av Monse\u00f1or Rivero, a stretch full of restaurants, cafes and bars. The bi-modal terminal (bus and railway station) is within the third anillo  but is still only a half-\nhour walk east from the center. The second to seventh anillos  are mainly residential \nand industrial.\nWithin the primer anillo,  Jun\u00edn is the \nstreet with most banks, ATMs and internet cafes, and Av Ren\u00e9 Moreno has loads of souvenir stores. To the northwest of the center, Av San Martin, otherwise known as Barrio Equipetrol, has tons of bars and clubs. \nMAPS\nThe best city map, Multiplano Santa Cruz \nCity Guide,  covers the first to fourth anillos  \nand is available free from the tourist of-fice.

Considering that even the remote parks of the Amazon Basin are coming under threat, Ambor\u00f3 feels \u2018people pressure\u2019 more than most.\nWhen Parque Nacional Ambor\u00f3 was created in 1973, its charter included a clause forbidding \nsettlement and resource exploitation. Unfortunately for naturalists and conservationists, hunters, loggers and campesino  (subsistence farmer) settlers continued to pour in \u2013 many of them \ndisplaced from the Chapare region by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. By 1996, with con-flicts increasing over the park, it was redesignated as the \u00c1rea de Uso M\u00faltiple Ambor\u00f3, which effectively opened it up for settlement. \nThis reducing of the park\u2019s protection status necessitated a change in tactics by local NGOs \nand conservation groups keen to avoid the complete destruction of the natural treasures of the region, but also fully aware of the needs of the human population. As a result, a number of responsible and sustainable \u2018community projects\u2019 have sprung up in the area, using tourism as a means of generating income for locals without them having to exploit their natural resources. The following are some of the more interesting of these projects:\nCandelaria Ecoalbergue \n(% 7600-7785; r per person B$150)  In the community of Candelaria 3km \nsouth of Buena Vista, this place manages comfortable four-person cabins and offers forest walks in the surrounding area.

To do it yourself, a micro  heads south from \nBuena Vista through Huayt\u00fa, San Rafael de Ambor\u00f3, Espejitos, Santa Rosa de Ambor\u00f3, Santa F\u00e9 and Las Cruces. This boundary provides access to several rough routes and tracks that lead southwest into the interior, following tributaries of the R\u00edo Surut\u00fa. To really probe into the park though you will need a 4WD vehicle and a good deal of pre-vious experience in jungle trekking. Note that all access to the park along this road will require a crossing of the R\u00edo Surut\u00fa. \nSANTA CRUZ TO SAMAIPATA\nThe spectacular route from Santa Cruz to Samaipata passes a number of attractions that are worth a brief stop.

A total of seven steps leading up to the main temple represent the seven phases of the moon. Zoomorphic designs on the slab include raised reliefs of pumas and jag-uars (representing power) and numerous serpents (representing fertility). Chicha  and \nblood were poured into the snake designs as an offering to Pachamama. Sadly, these designs are unprotected from the elements and erosion is making them harder to discern with every passing year.\nAbout 300m down an obscure track be-\nhind the main ruin is Chincana , a sinister \nhole in the ground that appears all the more menacing by the concealing vegetation and sloping ground around it. It\u2019s almost certainly natural, but three theories have emerged about how it might have been used: that it served as a water-storage cistern; that a kiosk with food and water next to the \nticket office.\nFirst occupied by diverse ethnic groups \nas early as 2000BC, it wasn\u2019t until 1470 that the Incas, the most famous tenants, first arrived. By the time the Spanish arrived and looted the site in the 1600s it was already deserted. The purpose of El Fuerte has long been debated, and there are several theories. The conquistadors, in a distinctly combative frame of mind, assumed the site had been used for defense, hence its Spanish name, \u2018the fort\u2019. In 1832 French naturalist Alcides d\u2019Orbigny proclaimed that the pools and parallel canals had been used for washing gold. In 1936 German anthropologist Leo Pucher described it as an ancient temple to the serpent and the jaguar; his theory, in-corporating worship of the sun and moon, is now the most accepted. Recently the place has gained a New Age following; some have claimed that it was a take-off and landing ramp for ancient spacecraft.\nThere are no standing buildings, but \nthe remains of 500 dwellings have been discovered in the immediate vicinity and \n17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   280 17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   280 8/12/09   09:31:58 8/12/09   09:31:58", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2367, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61e2434d-e354-4168-af54-ca2a68a4b463": {"__data__": {"id_": "61e2434d-e354-4168-af54-ca2a68a4b463", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "281", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b39771f-9dc3-4769-b648-91e4ee501cfb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "281", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "8a5cc3b675cd7ae01d5f816cadeaeb3d54a5876b3cd6c77260b2c0d906c89364", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "524b4136-a333-41a0-8ca1-9ff90761312c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "acf9756e6e1a8a737af56e124aa6c581c5be191680fee2bf0abef8a825b7e1e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SANTA CRUZ &\nGRAN CHIQUITANIABook your stay at lonelyplanet.com/hotels SANTA CRUZ & GRAN CHIQUITANIA  \u2022\u2022  Samaipata   281\ntours in English and German.

The better options include Alojamiento Teresita  \n(% 924-2151; Escalante/Mendoza 107)  and Hotel \nCopacabana  (% 942-2014; Escalante/Mendoza 100) .\nGetting There & Away\nFrom Plaza Oruro in Santa Cruz, buses and \ntaxis leave for Vallegrande (B$35 to B$60, seven hours) between 10am and 2pm. A flota  \nleaves from the bimodal terminal at 6pm. From Samaipata, taxis and micros  run every \ntwo hours or so along the spine-shakingly bouncy road (four hours). Taxis to La Higuera (B$200 \u2013 try haggling) via Pucar\u00e1 depart from the market, two blocks east of the main plaza along Sucre. \nVallegrande\u2019s new bus terminal 1km \nnorth of the center looks impressive, but very few services actually run from there. There are micros  to Santa Cruz every two hours \nfrom 9am to 1pm, and 6pm to 10pm, and a 6pm service to Cochabamba. Taxis to Samaipata and Santa Cruz leave when full, though it is frequently a very long wait.\nPUCAR\u00c1 \nPucar\u00e1 features on many of the Ch\u00e9 tours, largely because it helps break up the uncom-fortably bumpy journey from Vallegrande. Though it has no direct link to Ch\u00e9, the town itself is pleasant enough and typical of the Bolivian valley towns that dot the region. \nFrom here it is a further 15km along \na dusty track to La Higuera. The route is now traversable by ordinary vehicles, but it makes for a pleasant walk if the weather tours with local Ch\u00e9 expert Gonzalo Flores Guzm\u00e1n (\n%7318-6354). Tours start from \nB$150 per person for a group of four, or B$450 for a single person for a full day. An interesting aspect of the tour is the chance to chat with people who actually met Ch\u00e9 and gain a first-hand account of events.\nSights\nHOSPITAL SE\u00d1OR DE LA MALTA\nAfter Ch\u00e9 Guevara\u2019s execution in La Higuera, south of Vallegrande, his body was brought to the now-dilapidated hospital laundry here. The hospital still functions, but the laundry itself has now been cordoned off as a pilgrimage site, where graffiti pays homage to this controversial figure. To get here, head one block south of the plaza along Escalante, and then five blocks east along Malta. \nEL MAUSOLEO DEL CH\u00c9\nIn 1997, nearly 30 years af ter Ch\u00e9\u2019s death, \none of the soldiers who carried out the burial revealed that his body lay beneath Vallegrande\u2019s airstrip. The Bolivian and Cuban governments called for his exhu-mation and Ch\u00e9 was officially reburied in Santa Clara, Cuba on October 17, 1997.

Bolivia is where Ch\u00e9 went to his death and where his image is being fervently resurrected.\nFresh from revolutionary success in Cuba (and frustrating failure in the Congo), Ernesto \u2018Ch\u00e9\u2019 \nGuevara de la Serna was in search of a new project when he heard about the oppression of the working classes by dictator Ren\u00e9 Barrientos Ortu\u00f1o\u2019s military government in Bolivia. Strategically located at the heart of South America, Bolivia seemed like the perfect place from which to launch the socialist revolution on the continent. Though Fidel Castro had required him to sign a letter of resignation upon leaving Cuba, thereby publically distancing the Cuban government from Guevara\u2019s activities, the two remained in close contact throughout the Bolivian escapade. \nCh\u00e9\u2019s Bolivian base was established in 1966 at the farm \u00d1ancahuaz\u00fa, 250km southwest of \nSanta Cruz. Initially his corevolutionaries had no idea who he was, and only when his trademark beard began to grow back (he had shaved it off to arrive incognito in Bolivia) did they realize that they were in the presence of a living legend. Ch\u00e9 hoped to convince the campesinos  \n(subsistence farmers) that they were oppressed, and to inspire them to social rebellion, but was surprised to be met only with suspicion. In fact a cunning move by Ortu\u00f1o to grant campesinos  \nrights to their land had guaranteed their support and all but doomed Ch\u00e9\u2019s revolution to failure before it had even begun.\nBolivian Diary  was written by Ch\u00e9 during the final months of his life. Originally planned as a \nfirst-hand documentation of the revolution, it reads as a somewhat leisurely adventure. Despite occasional minor setbacks Ch\u00e9 considered things to be moving along nicely and in his last entry on 7 October 1967, 11 months after his arrival in Bolivia, he writes that the plan was proceeding \u2018without complications.\u2019 \nThe following day he was captured near La Higuera by CIA-trained Bolivian troops under \nthe command of Capit\u00e1n Gary Prado Salgrado, receiving bullet wounds to the legs, neck and shoulder. He was taken to a schoolroom in La Higuera and, just after noon on 9 October, he was executed by a flurry of bullets to the back of the neck from Salgrado\u2019s gun. The finishing touch was a final shot through the heart by Colonel Andr\u00e9s Selnich, Salgrado\u2019s immediate superior. Once the deed was done the assassins were said to be perturbed by the open eyes and peaceful smile on the dead revolutionary\u2019s face. \nThe body was flown to Vallegrande, where it was displayed in the hospital laundry room to \nprove to the whole world that \u2018El Ch\u00e9\u2019 was finally dead. Local women noted an uncanny resem-blance to the Catholic Christ and took locks of his hair as mementos, while the untimely deaths of many of those involved in his capture and assassination has led to widespread belief in the \u2018Curse of Ch\u00e9,\u2019 a sort of Tutankhamen-style beyond-the-grave retribution.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4039, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1048e132-3ff2-47e4-9c1d-031f0d0c11df": {"__data__": {"id_": "1048e132-3ff2-47e4-9c1d-031f0d0c11df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "285", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be2e10ab-d02a-4c12-b63e-48d2d7c7de90", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "285", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "aa81e09a4687a32758f49e1f59441b6528dc347bd45ad4bb121dc4b34d0abf85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8119fce0-1484-4762-9d4e-d88093560d8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "285", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "bdd3d8602c72b570b4b1a30624f513cd62a6d59d2ef17530ebb94a69dfe73ace", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The finishing touch was a final shot through the heart by Colonel Andr\u00e9s Selnich, Salgrado\u2019s immediate superior.

For \na time the Jesuit armies were the strongest and best trained on the continent. This makeshift military force served as a shield for the area from both the Portu-guese in Brazil and the Spanish to the west, an autonomous theocracy.\nPolitically, the reducci\u00f3nes  were under the \nnominal control of the audiencia  (judicial \ndistrict) of Chacras, and ecclesiastically under the bishop of Santa Cruz, though their relative isolation meant that the reduc-\nci\u00f3nes basically ran themselves. Internally, \nthe settlements were jointly administered by a few priests and a council of eight indig-enous representatives of the specific tribes who met daily to monitor community progress. Though the indigenous popula-tion was supposedly free to choose whether it lived within the missionary communities, the reality was that those who chose not to were forced to live under the harsh en-\ncomienda  (Spanish feudal system) or, worse \nstill, in outright slavery.\nThe Jesuit settlements reached their \npeak under the untiring Swiss priest Father Martin Schmidt, who not only built the mis-sions at San Xavier, Concepci\u00f3n and San Rafael de Velasco, but also designed many of the altars, created the musical instruments, acted as the chief composer for the reduc-\nci\u00f3nes  and published a Spanish\u2013Chiquitano \ndictionary. He was later expelled from the region and died in Europe in 1772.\nBy the mid-1700s, political strife in \nEurope had escalated into a power struggle between the Catholic Church and the gov-ernments of France, Spain and Portugal. When the Spanish realized the extent of Jesuit wealth and influence they decided to act. In 1767, swept up in a whirlwind of political babble and religious dogma, the missions were disbanded, and King Carlos III signed the Order of Expulsion, which evicted the Jesuits from the continent. In the wake of the Jesuit departure the set-tlements fell into decline, their amazing churches standing as mute testimony to their sudden achievements.\nInformation\nFor online information about the Gran Chiquitania region and the mission circuits, see www.destinochiquitos.com and www.chiquitania.com.now the local clinic \u2013 where Ch\u00e9 was kept before being executed is just off the plaza: it\u2019s the yellow building with a solar panel on the roof.\nEspecially for Ch\u00e9 tourists, La Casa del \nTelegrafista  \n(www.lacasadeltelegrafista.com; r per person \nB$50)  offers vegetarian lunches and rustic \nrooms in the historic house that was used by Ch\u00e9\u2019s unit to send and receive messages from the outside world. You can also stay in the school for B$10 per person, but note that it\u2019s very basic and there\u2019s no shower.\nGRAN CHIQUITANIA\nThe Gran Chiquitania is the area to the east of Santa Cruz where the hostile, thorny Chaco and the low, tropical savannas of the Amazon Basin have a stand-off. Watched by the foothills of the Cordillera Oriental to the west, the Llanos de Guarayos to the north and the international boundaries of Paraguay and Brazil to the south and east, these two vastly different landscapes stand together, never making peace.\nThe flat landscapes of the Chiquitania are \nbroken and divided by long, low ridges and odd monolithic mountains. Much of the territory lies soaking under vast marshes, part of the magnificent Pantanal region.

Departure times change constantly and it is worth inquiring locally about your onward trip on arrival.\nSan Miguel de Velasco\npop 10,300\nSleepy San Miguel hides in the scrub, 38km from San Ignacio. Its church  was founded \nin 1721 and is, according to the late Hans Roth, the most accurately restored of all the Bolivian Jesuit missions. Its spiral pillars, carved wooden altar with a flying San Miguel, extravagant golden pulpit, religious artwork, toylike bell tower and elaborately painted facade are simply superb.\nAlthough not designed by Martin \nSchmidt, the church does reflect his influ-ence and is generally considered the most beautiful of Bolivia\u2019s Jesuit missions. A unique feature of San Miguel is the presence of no fewer than seven bells in the bell tower. When rung in combination they transmit a complicated code language to the populace. The largest bell rung in tandem with two others signals the departure of a dignitary, rung alone it\u2019s the baptism of a child, while a special bell calls the faithful to prayer.

To reach Santa Ana with your own vehicle, use the right fork north of town.\nSan Jos\u00e9 de Chiquitos\npop 17,000\nAn atmospheric place, San Jos\u00e9 de Chiquitos has the appeal of an old Western film set. The frontier town, complete with dusty streets straight out of High Noon  and foot-\npaths shaded by pillar-supported roofs, is flanked on the south by a low escarpment and on the north by flat, soggy forest. With an enormous and handsome plaza flanked by toboroche  (thorny bottle) trees, the \nmost accessible Jesuit mission town is also arguably the nicest. \nThe Jesuits arrived sometime in the mid- \n1740s, and began construction of the magnificent town church in 1750.\nINFORMATION\nThere is no ATM in town but local banks will give cash advances on Visa and MasterCard. A useful tourist information office  \n(% 972-2084)  \nin the Alcald\u00eda on the corner of the plaza has information about all the missions.\nSIGHTS & ACTIVITIES\nJesuit Mission Church\nSan Jos\u00e9 has the only stone Jesuit mission church and merits a visit even if you miss all the others. Although the main altar is nearly identical to those in other nearby missions and has vague similarities to churches in Poland and Belgium, the reason behind its unusual exterior design remains unclear.\nThe church compound consists of four \nprincipal buildings arranged around the courtyard and occupying an entire city block. The bell tower was finished in 1748, the funerario  (death chapel) is dated 1752 \nand the parroquio  (living area) was com-\npleted in 1754. It is believed, however, that only the facades were finished before the Jesuits were expelled in 1767. All construc-tion work was done by the Chiquitano people under Jesuit direction.\nThe restoration of the church was nearing \ncompletion at the time of writing. Work has been going on for over a decade with some delay caused by the unexpected discovery of 1008 sq meters of glorious frescoes depicting locals recommend that you inquire about your onward travel on arrival. \nSanta Ana de Velasco\nThe mission at this tiny Chiquitano village, 24km north of San Rafael de Velasco, was established in 1755. The church , with its \nearthen floor and palm-frond roof, is more rustic than the others and recalls the first churches constructed by the Jesuit mission-aries upon their arrival. In fact the building itself is post-Jesuit, but the interior contains exquisite religious carvings and paintings.\nGiven its age, the original structure was \nin remarkable condition and the church has been recently restored. During renovations a diatonic harp, more than 1.5m tall, was found; it\u2019s displayed in the church and is a lovely complement to the local children\u2019s music practice.\nSan Rafael de Velasco\npop 5000\nSan Rafael de Velasco, 132km north of San Jos\u00e9 de Chiquitos, was founded in 1696. Its church  was constructed between 1743 and \n1747, the first of the mission churches to be completed in Bolivia. In the 1970s and 1980s the building was restored, along with the churches in Concepci\u00f3n and San Jos\u00e9 de Chiquitos.\nThe interior is particularly beautiful, and \nthe original paintings and woodwork remain intact. The pulpit is covered with a layer of lustrous mica, the ceiling is made of reeds and the spiral pillars were carved from cuchi  \n(ironwood) logs. It\u2019s the only mission church to retain the original style, with cane sheath-ing. Most interesting are the lovely music-theme paintings in praise of God along the entrance wall, which include depictions of a harp, flute, bassoon, horn and maracas.\nAt the corner of the main road and the \nstreet running south from the church, the Casa de Hu\u00e9spedes San Rafael  \n(% 962-4018; r per \nperson B$30)  has basic rooms with shared bath-\nroom, good enough for a night\u2019s stay.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3953, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e0621a2-5da1-4ffb-aaa7-b32401e3531f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e0621a2-5da1-4ffb-aaa7-b32401e3531f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "290", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e953a1ed-595b-4f3e-a50e-6363224296b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "290", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "bc471053e7ee7e1b6d5f381f5cbab3dbc3e33643553296f381384abb4ddf261d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d3fbe90-d6c7-43fb-881f-cb02945ce95b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "290", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "c5fb38ccedabe20429e7850d2bfed0634a0d44a5e33b1464b6cb575706169471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The interior is particularly beautiful, and \nthe original paintings and woodwork remain intact.

The round-trip taxi fare from Robor\u00e9 is B$100 for up to four people.\nThe 40\u00b0C  (105\u00b0F) thermal baths at Aguas \nCalientes , 31km east of Robor\u00e9, are popular \nwith Bolivian visitors who believe in their curative powers. Taxis charge B$100 for up to four passengers and though the train stops here it does so in the middle of the night. There is nowhere to stay but it makes for a great day trip.the history of the town from the Jesuit era to the Spanish colonization.\nSanta Cruz la Vieja Walk\nJust south of town, an archway  supported \nby ba\u00f1istas  (literally \u2018bathers\u2019, in this case \nwomen protecting their modesty with towels) indicates your entry into the Zona \nBaln\u00e9aria  where there are a number of open-\nair swimming options. \nA few kilometers further along is the \nParque Hist\u00f3rico Santa Cruz la Vieja \n(admission B$10)  \nsite of the original city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The only thing left behind of the old city is an abandoned guardhouse. Just be-yond here is a statue of town founder \u00d1uflo de Chavez next to a reconstructed choza  \u2013 \na typical Chiquitano dwelling with the characteristic low doorway used for de-fensive purposes. Excavations taking place at the time of writing were believed to be uncovering the original church.\nUphill from here there is a trek to the \nCataratas del Suton  waterfall and a stunning \nviewpoint, though it is easy to get lost and a guide is recommended.

It offers wide-ranging luxury, 600 hectares of grounds and several restaurants, as well as a number of touristic packages exploring the Pantanal.\nBoth these hotels have good restaurants. \nAlternatively, lots of inexpensive places are lined up along the street perpendicular to the railway station entrance.CROSSING THE BORDER TO BRAZIL\nThe main border crossing to Brazil is at Quijarro at the end of the train line, with a second, minor \ncrossing at San Mat\u00edas, the access point to the northern Brazilian Pantanal.\nYou\u2019ll more than likely arrive in Quijarro by train between 7am and 9am to be greeted by a line \nof taxi drivers offering to take you the 2km to the border (B$5). Customs offices (h 8am-noon & \n2-5:30pm)  are on opposing sides of the bridge. Bolivian officials have been known to unofficially \ncharge for the exit stamp, but stand your ground politely. Crossing this border you are generally asked to show a yellow-fever vaccination certificate. No exceptions are granted and you will be whisked off to a vaccination clinic if you fail to produce it. On the Brazilian side of the border yellow canarinho (city buses) will take you into Corumb\u00e1 (R$1.70). Brazilian entry stamps are \ngiven at the border or at the Pol\u00edcia Federal at the rodovi\u00e1ria (haw-doo-vyahr-ya; bus terminal); \nit\u2019s open until 5pm. Get your stamp as soon as possible to avoid later problems and make sure you have the necessary visas if you require them.\nFor a slightly more adventurous border crossing try San Mat\u00edas. In the dry season, a Trans-Bolivia \nbus leaves from Santa Cruz to C\u00e1ceres in Brazil (30 hours), via San Mat\u00edas (26 hours). Brazilian entry or exit stamps should be picked up from the Pol\u00edcia Federal office at Rua Ant\u00f4nio Jo\u00e3o 160 in C\u00e1ceres; get your exit and entry stamps for Bolivia in Santa Cruz (p266).\n17-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   29317-santa-cruz-granchiq-bol7.indd   293 9/12/09   17:41:169/12/09   17:41:16\u00a9 Lonely Planet\n\u00a9 Lonely Planet.

The rainforest \nis raucous with wildlife and spending a few days roaming the sweaty jungle is an experi-ence you\u2019re unlikely to forget. This is where you\u2019ll find the deep and mysterious lushness that has drawn adventurers and explorers since the beginning of time. And it\u2019s not only the forests that are enchanting: it\u2019s also the richness of the indigenous cultures, traditions and languages that exist throughout the region.\nWhile Brazilian rainforests continue to suffer heavy depredation, the Amazon forests of \nnorthern Bolivia remain relatively intact; unfortunately, though, the region continues to face the serious problems of road construction and highland immigration that have led to an upsurge in logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. \nMossy hills peak around the town of Rurrenabaque, most people\u2019s first point of entry into the \nregion and the main base camp from where to visit the fascinating Parque Nacional Madidi. This is home to a growing ethno-ecotourism industry that looks to help local communities. The village of San Ignacio de Moxos has a kicking July fiesta where indigenous traditions, mixed with a strong Jesuit missionary influence, are vigorously celebrated. Trinidad, the region\u2019s biggest settlement and an active cattle ranching center, is a transit point toward Santa Cruz.\nAll of the Amazon Basin\u2019s main rivers are Amazon tributaries that would be considered \ngreat rivers in their own right in any smaller country. You can indulge in long journeys down these jungle waterways, using hotel-like riverboats, cargo boats, canoes or barges.AMAZON BASIN\n18-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   29418-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   294 9/12/09   17:42:559/12/09   17:42:55\u00a9 Lonely Planet", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2460, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03147fa3-17c8-40da-8d27-9bc03dc75390": {"__data__": {"id_": "03147fa3-17c8-40da-8d27-9bc03dc75390", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "295", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9c085b0-adc7-4aa9-94c8-b9fc74b826d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "295", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "b8e7d01350889a244caa5b68a281b3aad2c42158c541db2704b5f9a6f7a8aa8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2efd1e6-1be8-4d76-91c4-a9feb8b77849", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0981188a4cfa2d6f5dc4ebe38654763b7066e229eefd5f98091e332bffc32855", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comAMAZON BASINAMAZON BASIN  \u2022\u2022  History   295\n(November to April) there are unrelenting \ndownpours and the streets may fill with mud and the sound of croaking frogs. The dry season (May to October) also sees a good measure of precipitation, and if you\u2019re unlucky you may experience the unpre-dictable surazo,  a cold wind blowing from \nPatagonia and the Argentine pampas. This produces a dramatic drop in temperature and frost even in the hottest parts of the jungle.\nNational Parks & Reserves\nThe Bolivian Amazon is blessed with some of the most biodiverse habitats on earth, and the country\u2019s best-known national parks and reserves. For birdwatchers, monkey lovers and jaguar seekers, this region is heaven. You can choose between the jungles and wild rivers of Parque Nacional Madidi (p308), the less-frequented, wildlife-rich Reserva Biosf\u00e9rica del Beni (p309) and the virtually unexplored \u2018lost world\u2019 of Parque Nacional Noel Kempff Mercado (p318). Conservation International  \n(www.conservation.org)  \nis attempting to raise awareness of the need for protection of the headwaters of several major Amazon tributaries with their ambi-tious Vilcabamba-Ambor\u00f3 Conservation Corridor initiative.\nGetting There & Around\nRurrenabaque is the Amazon\u2019s most popular settlement. Flying is the best way of getting here, though many choose to take the tedious and uncomfortable bus ride from La Paz to save money. Buses going back to La Paz from Rurrenabaque are less crowded \u2013 many people decide to wing it (or take a faster 4WD) after surviving the initial bus ride.\nTransportes A\u00e9reos Militares (TAM) and \nAmaszonas  fly daily between La Paz and \nRurrenabaque. Their low-flying planes afford great glimpses of Lake Titicaca after take-off before squeezing past Chacaltaya and soaring over the Yungas. You can see the landscape change from desolate, rugged highlands to lush, forested lowlands. And the grass landing strip in Rurrenabaque is worthy of more than one post-trip tale.\nGenerally, 4WDs are necessary to reach \nmost off-road spots, but there are regular bus services between major towns. Boat travel is big here, especially in the rainy season, when it is usually the only real option. Riverboat travel isn\u2019t for everyone: History\nThe Bolivian Amazon has always oozed mystery. The Incas believed that a powerful civilization lived in the great rainforest, and tried to conquer the area in the 15th cen-tury. The indigenous peoples of the west-ern Bolivian Amazon, mainly the Moxos tribe, are said to have posed such a mighty resistance to the invading army that, once they realized they were unable to beat them, \nthe Incas asked for an alliance and settled among the Moxos.\nThe tale of the Incas\u2019 experience fired \nthe imagination of the Spanish conquerors a century later \u2013 they too were chasing a legend in search of a rich and powerful civilization in the depths of the Amazonian forest. The name of the kingdom was El Dorado (the Golden One) or Paitit\u00ed (the Land of the Celestial Jaguar), thought to have existed east of the Andean Cordillera, near the source of the R\u00edo Paraguay. The Spanish spent the entire 16th century trying to find the elusive kingdom, but, unfamiliar with the rainforest environment, found nothing but death and disease. By the 17th century they moved their search elsewhere.\nThough the Spanish were disappointed \nwith their search in the Moxos region, the Jesuits saw their opportunity to \u2018spread the word\u2019 to the highly spiritual moxe\u00f1os . The \ntough missionaries were the first Europeans to significantly venture into the lowlands. They founded their first mission at Loreto, in the Moxos region, in 1675. While they imposed Christianity and European ways, the Jesuits also recognized the indigenous peoples\u2019 expertise in woodwork, which eventually produced the brilliant carvings now characteristic of the missions. They imported herds of cattle and horses to some of their remote outposts, and the descend-ants of these herds still thrive throughout most of the department.\nAfter the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, the \nFranciscan and Dominican missionaries, as well as the opportunistic settlers who followed, brought slavery and disease.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2efd1e6-1be8-4d76-91c4-a9feb8b77849": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2efd1e6-1be8-4d76-91c4-a9feb8b77849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "295", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9c085b0-adc7-4aa9-94c8-b9fc74b826d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "295", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "b8e7d01350889a244caa5b68a281b3aad2c42158c541db2704b5f9a6f7a8aa8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "03147fa3-17c8-40da-8d27-9bc03dc75390", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "295", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "2f4ac23d3ef4330a4f9a6925aa8db9d9a8f0b8534253c05a7f83d5472afb934e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "By the 17th century they moved their search elsewhere.\nThough the Spanish were disappointed \nwith their search in the Moxos region, the Jesuits saw their opportunity to \u2018spread the word\u2019 to the highly spiritual moxe\u00f1os .

The contrast is breathtaking on the spectacular road between Cochabamba and Villa Tunari, where twists around the high peaks and mountain lakes drop steeply into deep, steaming tropical valleys.\nThe Chapare region is heavily populated \nwith highland campesinos  (subsistence \nfarmers) who emigrated here in the 1970s and started growing the controversial coca leaf, turning the region into Bolivia\u2019s main source of coca grown for the manufacture of cocaine (as opposed to Yungas coca, which makes up the bulk of what Bolivians themselves chew, make into tea etc).

It also offers live-70 species of tropical orchids. There\u2019s also a small museum  that is worth visiting, El \nBosque restaurant and a couple of caba\u00f1as \n(cabins) available for rent. It\u2019s just north of the highway, 2km west of town near the tranca  (police post).\nSACRED COCA?\nErythroxylum coca  is the scientific name for coca, a plant of the family Erythroxylaceae, native to \nnorthwestern South America. A small tree growing to a height of seven to 10 feet, the species is identified by its long, opaque, green leaves and small clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which mature into red berries. In Bolivia the plant grows primarily in the Yungas (p119), north of La Paz, and in the Chapare region of the Amazon. \nBut, unless you are a botanist, or have a strange taste in garden plants, you are likely to have \nheard of coca for other reasons \u2013 prince among them being its role in the production of the narcotic cocaine. To make the drug, leaves are dried, soaked in kerosene and mashed into a pasty pulp. Then they are treated with hydrochloric and sulfuric acids until they form a foul-smelling brown base. Further treatment with petrol and other chemicals creates cocaine.\nFor most Bolivians, however, the expensive white powder snorted by party-goers worldwide \nhas nothing to do with their sacred plant, and they resent the suggestion that they should be held responsible for anyone else\u2019s misuse of it. President Evo Morales, a former cocalero  (coca \ngrower) himself, has vowed to continue to fight the war against narcotrafficking, but not at the expense of the country\u00b4s coca industry \u2013 according to his government, the two are very differ-ent animals. During his address to the UN on the issue in 2006, Morales held up a coca leaf to demonstrate that the leaf and cocaine are not the same (p28).\nSo what else is coca used for? Coca has formed a part of the religious rituals of the inhabitants of the Altiplano since the \npre-Inca period and plays a fundamental part in offerings to the Gods Apus  (mountains), Inti \n(sun) and Pachamama  (earth). It is drunk as a tea ( mate de coca ) or chewed to combat altitude \nsickness or overcome fatigue and hunger. To picchar  (to chew coca, from the Aymar\u00e1) involves \nmasticating a pile of leaves stored as a ball in the cheek. The ball is added to continuously and saliva passed over the mass has a mild stimulant and anesthetic effect on the user. Furthermore chewing coca also serves as a powerful symbol of religious and cultural identity. \nDuring the conquest the Spanish rulers were somewhat perturbed by the religious connota-\ntions that came with the consumption of the leaf by the local population. Seeing it as a potential obstacle to their evangelization of the masses, they were, however, aware that consumption greatly increased output by the labor force. It was a double-edged sword which led King Philip II to permit its use as \u2018essential to the well-being of the Indians\u2019 but to discourage its association with religious practices. \nOutside Bolivia, most people know that cocaine was the original active ingredient in Coca-\nCola, but few realize that the plant is still involved in the manufacture of the fizzy drink. Medical company Stepan is one of the very few to possess a license permitting it to possess the plant  and its derivatives in the US, and it imports 100 tonnes of dried leaf annually, some of it for  the manufacture of medicines, some of it for the production of a cocaine-free derivative used by Coca-Cola as a flavoring agent.\nThe appearance of the leaf in Europe pre-dates Coca-Cola, though, and it was first imported in \nthe 16th century. Its usage didn\u2019t become popular until the mid-19th century with the invention of cocaine and only later the production of pure cocaine.\nBut regardless of attitudes in Bolivia, those of the outside world remain, for the most part, \nunchanged.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4134, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "662fe530-c597-4480-ac38-a5fd02808b3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "662fe530-c597-4480-ac38-a5fd02808b3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5f92ce5-3771-4a2a-b93b-ccc22f128d1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "333a3bef49bb357dad28350d811cd468a6aa65a1f080d7defbaa2a547c9a726f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c173d518-64a2-4551-ae0b-9678d7b11dcd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "b0e0635ae2893d9ab5ff3396581730e54ea3df9e4de88c582741d0b671f742f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Outside Bolivia, most people know that cocaine was the original active ingredient in Coca-\nCola, but few realize that the plant is still involved in the manufacture of the fizzy drink.

For a quick look at the rainforests, it makes an easy two-day round-trip from Cochabamba. Bring lots of insect repellent and wear strong old shoes with lots of tread. Even in the dry season things can get muddy.\nSights & Activities\nTwo types of boat run between Puerto Villarroel and Trinidad. The small family-run cargo boats that putter up and down the R\u00edos Ichilo and Mamor\u00e9 normally only travel by day and reach Trinidad in around six days. Larger commercial crafts travel day and night and do the run in three or four days.\nIn Puerto Villarroel, the Capitan\u00eda del \nPuerto and other related portside offices can provide sketchy departure information on cargo transporters. Unless military ex-ercises or labor strikes shut down cargo services, you shouldn\u2019t have more than a three- or four-day wait. Note that when the river is low you will have much more difficulty finding a boat.\nThe average fare to Trinidad on either \ntype of boat is B$150 to B$200, including food (it\u2019s still wise to carry emergency rations), a bit less without meals. The quality of food varies from boat to boat, but overall the shipboard diet consists of fish, dried meat, masaco  (mashed yucca or \nplantain) and fruit; avoid endangered turtle eggs if they\u2019re offered. You might want to bring some snacks to help supplement your diet. Few boats along the Ichilo have cabins. Most passengers sleep in hammocks slung out in the main lounge. A mosquito net is a wise investment.\nIf you are not up to the odyssey of a multi-\nday river cruise, ask around at the port for owners of lanchas  (small boats). For a nego-\ntiable fee they can organize day-long fishing or camping trips to nearby river beaches, as well as visits to nearby indigenous settle-ments. In the spirit of responsible tourism offer to pay what you consider a fair price; a gift of diesel is always welcome.\nSleeping & Eating\nAccommodation options are extremely basic, with a bunch of run-down residen-\nciales  (simple accommodations) clustered \naround the central plaza; they charge Ivargazama (B$12, one hour), then another to Shinahota (B$10, 45 minutes) and finally one to Villa Tunari (B$5, 30 minutes). It sounds more complicated than it really is and is a good way of avoiding waiting around for a bus. Taxis from Cochabamba leave from the corner of Avs Oquendo and Rep\u00fablica throughout the day when full (B$40, three hours). \nPARQUE NACIONAL CARRASCO\nCreated in 1988, this 622,600-hectare park has some of Bolivia\u2019s most easily explored cloud forest. It skirts a large portion of the road between Cochabamba and Villa Tunari, and also includes a big lowland area of the Chapare region. The rainforest hides a vast variety of mammal species, together with a rainbow of birds, crawling reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects.\nThe easiest way to visit is with Fremen \nTours (p196). Tour programs include the Cavernas del Repech\u00f3n (Caves of the Night \nBirds), where you\u2019ll see the weird, nocturnal gu\u00e1chero  (oilbird) and six bat species. \nAccess is from the village of Paractito, 8km west of Villa Tunari. This half-day excur-sion involves a short slog through the rainforest and a zippy crossing of the R\u00edo San \nMateo  in a cable-car contraption.\nAnother interesting option is the Con-\nservation International-backed Camino en las \nNubes (Walk in the Clouds) project, a three-\nday trek through the park\u2019s cloud forests, descending with local guides from 4000m to 300m along the old Cochabamba\u2013Chapare road.

But, as with most development, there are drawbacks, and in this case, it\u2019s the plethora of tour operators who are often much less responsible than they ought to be.\n\u2018Ecofriendly\u2019 operators of pampas and jungle tours are also cropping up on every corner of \nRurrenabaque\u2019s streets. Many undercut the official prices and, despite claiming to be ecofriendly, don\u2019t respect the environment they work in. Inorganic waste is often left at campsites, animals are handled and disturbed, and travelers\u2019 safety is often compromised, with inexperienced guides not knowing what to do in an emergency. This is largely a result of over-demanding budget travelers expecting low prices and high delivery: perceiving the large number of operators as fair game for bartering, they beat the operators\u2019 prices down to the minimum and demand guarantees of spotting wildlife.\nBear in mind that spotting caimans, anacondas, piranhas and other Amazonian animals is a \nprivilege, not a right. Operators and guides should not promise animal sightings (this encourages their unethical capture), go looking for wildlife or, under any circumstances, feed or handle any animals. One reader wrote in with this report: \u2018Ecofriendly-wise, our operators were pretty awful \u2013 grabbing hold of anacondas when they found them and capturing baby caimans to show us. We heard that one adult caiman was captured and bit its own tail off in a panic.\u2019\nChoose your operator carefully. Talk to other travelers and keep in mind the basic stan dards \nthat guides should adhere to, and, most importantly, be responsible in your own expecta-tions. Better still, opt for one of the community-run ecotourism ventures, which, although more expensive, are definitely more worthwhile and aim to help sustain communities and preserve the richness of the rainforests for the generations to come.\nShop around to get an idea of official prices. Any agency undercutting rates should be regarded \nwith caution. Only SERNAP-authorized operators are allowed to enter Parque Nacional Madidi and foreigners must be accompanied by a local guide. Note that to get the most out of these tours, at least a minimal knowledge of Spanish is required. \nJungle Tours\nThe Bolivian rainforest is full of more interesting and unusual things than you could ever imagine. Local guides, most of whom have grown up in the area, are knowledgeable about the fauna, flora and forest lore; they can explain animals\u2019 habits and habitats and demonstrate the uses of some of the thousands of plant species, including the forest\u2019s natural remedies for colds, fever, cuts, insect bites (which come in handy!) and other ailments. Note that you are likely to see a lot more plants than animals.\nMost trips are by canoe upstream along the R\u00edo Beni, and some continue up the R\u00edo Tuichi, \ncamping and taking shore and jungle walks along the way, with plenty of swimming opportunities and hammock time. Accommodations are generally in agencies\u2019 private camps.\nRain, mud and marigu\u00ed  (sandflies) make the wet season (especially January to March) unpleasant \nfor jungle tours, but some agencies have camps set up for wildlife watching at this time.\nPampas Tours\nIt\u2019s easier to see wildlife in the wetland savannas northeast of town, but the sun is more op-pressive, and the bugs can be worse, especially in the rainy season. Bring binoculars, a good flashlight, extra batteries and plenty of strong anti-bug juice. Highlights include playful pink river dolphins, horseback riding and night-time canoe trips to spot caiman.\n18-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   Sec1:304 18-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   Sec1:304 8/12/09   09:23:51 8/12/09   09:23:51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4350, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d6eb775-1162-46dc-8e36-0b2dd9115f4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d6eb775-1162-46dc-8e36-0b2dd9115f4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "305", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f419d681-3a07-4fbc-8966-5108a2309dfc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "305", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "f4ab45d73a546aecefd03751289a7bbf4330f484dc2465ac4fad53a5366fa6f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "930261a2-fe51-439b-8f6f-9acde068b569", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "25709c9f9d6a2c8f6e7c51d5bb1cb56966d86f017af88fe072e00920d7151f36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comAMAZON BASINWESTERN BOLIVIAN AMAZON  \u2022\u2022  Rurrenabaque   305\na bit like the House that Jack Built, so be \ncareful on the staircase after indulging in the exotic frozen cocktails during the nightly happy hour.\nCaf\u00e9 Pira\u00f1a \n(Santa Cruz nr Avaroa s/n; mains B$25-40)  \nThis Pira\u00f1a has bite, with a great chill-out area, delicious vegetarian and meat dishes, yummy breakfasts, lovely fresh juices, a library and film screenings every night in the back garden. \nLa Perla de Rurre  \n(Bol\u00edvar at Vaca Diez; mains B$30-\n45) Everyone in Rurre will tell you that this \nis their favorite restaurant and \u2018The Pearl\u2019 does indeed serve up some mean fresh fish and chicken dishes.

It\u2019s frustrating for anybody wanting to travel between Rurrenabaque and Trinidad, and even more so when buses that set out from Rurre bound for Trinidad announce, after a little local consultation at San Borja, that they can go no further.

During the wet season the trip to Trinidad is sometimes attempted by privately owned 4WD vehicles (B$100) commissioned by the bus companies, though whether they depart or not depends on the whim of the driver. There are frequent micro  services to Rurrenabaque (B$30, five \nto eight hours), which depart when full. \nIf you\u2019re Trinidad-bound, note that the \nR\u00edo Mamor\u00e9 balsa  (raft) crossings close at \n6pm, and you need five to six hours to reach them from San Borja.

SERNAP\u2019s Parque Nacional \nMadidi headquarters  (% 892-2540)  and a tourist \ninformation office, staffed by agencies authorized to conduct tours in the park, provide visitor information.\nPARQUE NACIONAL MADIDI \nThe R\u00edo Madidi watershed is one of South America\u2019s most intact ecosystems. Most of it is protected by the 1.8 million-hectare Parque Nacional Madidi, which takes in a range of wildlife habitats, from the steam-ing lowland rainforests to 5500m Andean peaks. This little-trodden utopia is home to an astonishing variety of Amazonian wild-life: 44% of all New World mammal species, 38% of tropical amphibian species, almost 1000 kinds of bird and more protected species than any park in the world.\nThe populated portions of the park along \nthe R\u00edo Tuichi have been accorded a special Unesco designation permitting indigenous inhabitants to utilize traditional forest resources, but the park has also been con-sidered for oil exploration and as a site for a major hydroelectric scheme in the past. In addition, illicit logging has affected several areas around the park perimeter and there\u2019s been talk of a new road between Apolo and Ixiamas that would effectively bisect the park. Though the hydroelectric scheme has been abandoned, the debate continues over whether road building and oil explora-tion will take place, and many suspect that illegal loggers will use the opportunity to benefit from these projects. \nIt is difficult to visit the park indepen-\ndently, but if you wish to do so the B$95 admission fee is payable at the SERNAP office in San Buenaventura \u2013 you must be accompanied by an authorized guide.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3978, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f976fa29-7760-46a6-9963-467698c26946": {"__data__": {"id_": "f976fa29-7760-46a6-9963-467698c26946", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "308", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b194edf9-9200-4a3c-b092-47ba4fdb658d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "308", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "2507508a0b9154addad948375de03d2463dba89775497f4e9f0b3b8ffa9900f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c2ccbe2-3197-4e0f-b265-d4c6d9066d21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "308", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "d288bbd8b5f4ce27ffc9d3620c72c5e681228a9f872b60e45bb6b685470ce29c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The populated portions of the park along \nthe R\u00edo Tuichi have been accorded a special Unesco designation permitting indigenous inhabitants to utilize traditional forest resources, but the park has also been con-sidered for oil exploration and as a site for a major hydroelectric scheme in the past.

The people speak an indigenous dialect known locally as Ignaciano, and their lifestyle, traditions and food are unique in the country. The best time to visit San Ignacio is during the annual festival on July 30 and 31. This is when the villagers let their hair down and get their feather headgear up, and don\u2019t stop drink-ing, dancing and letting off fireworks for three days (see opposite).\nThe village was founded as San Ignacio de \nLoyola by the Jesuits in 1689. In 1749 it suf-fered pestilence and had to be shifted to its present location on healthier ground. \nSights & Activities\nIn the main plaza is a monument  to \nChir\u00edpieru, El Machetero Ignaciano, with his crown of feathers and formidable-looking hatchet, a look that\u2019s recreated exten-sively during the village festival. The church  \n(h 8am-7pm)  on the plaza was restored and \nrebuilt from 1995 to 2003 and adopts the familiar Jesuit style with a wide roof sup-ported by wooden columns, though they are noticeably smooth and without deco-ration in this example. If you get a small group together, one of the church workers will take you around for a small fee.\nAt the museum  \n(admission B$5)  in the Casa \nBel\u00e9n, near the northwest corner of the plaza, you\u2019ll see elements of both the Ignaciano and Moxos cultures, including the bajones,  the immense flutes introduced \nby the Jesuits.\nNorth of town at the large Laguna Isirere , \nyou can go fishing and swimming, observe the profuse bird life and watch the gorgeous sunset. A statue on the shores depicts the local legend about the formation of the lake.

This friendly and well-organized village of 140 people lies hidden in the forest of the Chimane reserve. The Chimane, tradition-ally a nomadic forest tribe, have in recent times faced expulsion from their ancestral lands by lumber companies and highland settlers. Skilled hunters, the Chimane people have a fascinating way of fishing, using natural poisons to kill their prey. They are also highly adept at collecting wild honey and avoiding ballistic bees. People living in the settlement of Cero Ocho , a four-hour walk \nfrom Totaizal, trudge into the village to sell bananas, while others provide guiding services for visitors. You can visit the village of Totaizal, but you\u2019ll have to make prior arrangements through El Porvenir.\nSleeping & Eating\nAccommodations at El Porvenir  are in airy \nbunk-bed rooms that cost B$100 per person (price includes three simple meals).

This is one of the best festivals in the Amazon and if you\u2019re in Bolivia during this time, you\u2019d be crazy to miss it. \nStrictly speaking, the festival begins on July 22 and gets off to a strange start. The small statue \nof Santiago from the church is paraded and worshipped each evening until July 25 (D\u00eda de la Fiesta de Santiago), after which point the same statue is then worshipped as an image of San Ignacio for the rest of the fiesta ! During this time each family in the village brings an image of \nSan Ignacio to the church and places it there in his honor. These solemn processions continue for another four days before the real festivities begin.\nOn July 30, a procession leaves from the church incorporating macheteros (local youths dressed \nin white with remarkable radial headdresses traditionally made from macaw feathers), achus (village \nelders with wooden masks and hats bearing fireworks) and musicians beating out the tunes of the unique Moxos music \u2013 using drums, enormous bamboo pan-pipes and flutes. One by one the proces-sion visits every house in the village, returning the images of San Ignacio that had been deposited in the church and receiving food and drink in return. The winding route ends at the church, where they attend Mass, its close signifying the end of formalities and the beginning of festivities.\nThe evening of the first day of fiesta starts with huge fireworks let off by two rich local \nfamilies outside the church, who \u2018compete\u2019 with each other through the lavishness of their displays.

For optimum enjoyment, visit during the dry season, which lasts roughly from May or June until some time in October.\nAlthough the scenery along the northern rivers changes little, the diversity of plant and animal \nspecies along the shore picks up any slack in the pace of the journey. The longer your trip, the deeper you\u2019ll gaze into the forest darkness and the more closely you\u2019ll scan the riverbanks for signs of movement. Free of the pressures and demands of active travel, you\u2019ll have time to relax and savor the passing scene.\nIn general, the riverboat food is pretty good, but meals consist mainly of masaco (mashed \nyucca or plantains, served with charque (dried meat),  rice, noodles, thin soup and bananas in \nevery conceivable form. After a couple of days you\u2019ll probably start dreaming of pizza, so bring along some treats to supplement the daily fare. It\u2019s also wise to carry your own water or some form of water purification.\nBe sure to discuss sleeping arrangements with the captain before setting out.

But it\u2019s \nnot just the sheer quantity of species that makes Bolivia such an attractive destination for bird lovers; it is the quality of the birds you can see.\nAsociac\u00edon Armon\u00eda, the Bolivian Birdlife International Partner, has developed a series of \ncommunity-based conservation programs designed to protect the country\u00b4s most threatened birds, principally by creating a feeling of pride among the locals. \nThe gorgeous Blue-throated Macaw \n(Ara glaucogularis) , endemic to the unique Beni savan-\nnas, numbers, according to the most optimistic of estimates, just 250 individuals. Known to the Bolivians as Barba Azul (Blue Beard), this charismatic bird has become a flagship species for Armon\u00eda, which runs a superb, community-orientated conservation program aimed squarely at making sure the bird is around for future generations to appreciate.\nThreats to the species are numerous, but one of the most unusual is indiscriminate killing for \nthe sole purpose of harvesting the tail feathers. This practice affects all macaws, but because of the species\u2019 similarity to the common Blue and Yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna)  and a lack of public \nawareness of its plight, this species has suffered at the hands of hunters who collect the tail plumes to adorn ceremonial headdresses for regional celebrations like the famous Moxos festival.\nArmonia\u2019s response has been rapid, effective and ingenious. It has worked on an extensive \npublic education campaign designed to teach locals how to distinguish between the two similar blue macaws that occur in the area and, crucially, to instill a sense of pride in the citizens of Beni for their emblematic bird. An agreement with local indigenous leaders not to hunt live macaws, but to instead fabricate artificial feathers for headdresses has not only been a huge success, but has led to the creation of a small and very lucrative local manufacturing industry. Perhaps most important of all has been the purchase of a small reserve dedicated to the conservation of the bird, which Armon\u00eda hopes to develop for ecotourism, bringing much-needed foreign income to the area. \nThe endangered Red-fronted Macaw (Ara rubrogenys)  known locally as Paraba frente roja  reflects \nits Bolivian specialty status in its red, green and yellow plumage \u2013 the colors of the national flag. Found only in dry inter-Andean valleys in the Vallegrande area, this handsome bird has a world population of just 1000. Thanks to an extensive public awareness campaign, Armon\u00eda was able to raise the funds to purchase a small reserve dedicated to the conservation of the bird, and with the construction of a superb and comfortable lodge \n(B$490 full board)  they are now encouraging \ntourism as a means of sustainably supporting the reserve. \nEqually endangered, the bizarre Horned Currasow (Pauxi unicornis) , has been styled the \u2018Unicorn \nBird\u2019 by the popular press on account of the weird, bony growth on its forehead. The species stronghold is in Ambor\u00f3, but with a world population estimated to be as low as 1000, and a dependence on dense, undisturbed humid forest, it is in imminent danger of extinction. A rustic, community-operated eco-lodge \n(B$280 full board) , supported by Armon\u00eda, has been set up in an \neffort to conserve the bird. \nStrangely beautiful, the Palkachupa (Phibalura boliviana), is endemic to the Apolo region of \nthe Bolivian Yungas.

For information on boat travel from either port, see p315.THE AMAZONIAN EL DORADO\nIn the Llanos de Moxos, between San Ignacio de Moxos and Loreto, the heavily forested land-\nscape is crossed with more than 100km of canals and causeways and dotted with hundreds of lomas (artificial mounds), embankments and fanciful prehistoric earthworks depicting people and animals. One anthropomorphic figure measures over 2km from head to toe \u2013 a rainforest variation on Peru\u2019s famed Nazca Lines. The original purpose of the earthworks was probably to permit cultivation in a seasonally flooded area, but inside the mounds were buried figurines, pottery, ceramic stamps, human remains and even tools made from stone imported into the region.\nThe discovery of the lomas has caused scientists to look at the Beni region with entirely new eyes: \nwhat was previously considered to be a wilderness never touched by humans, save for a few dispersed tribes who inhabited the region, is now thought to have been an area where a vast, advanced civiliza-tion farmed, worked and lived in a highly structured society with sophisticated cities. \nIt is believed that the ceramic mounds came from the large numbers of people who lived on \nthem and who ate and drank from pots, which were then destroyed and buried to improve soil stability. Archaeologists say that the sheer amount of pots indicates the complexity of this lost society. In 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus  (Knopf, 2005) Charles C Mann \nwrites following the archaeologist Clark Erickson of the University of Pennsylvania: \n[\u2026] beginning as much as three thousand years ago, this long-ago society\u2026created one of the largest, strangest, and most ecologically rich artificial environments on the planet. These people built up the mounds for homes and farms, constructed the causeways and canals for transporta-tion and communication, created the fish weirs to feed themselves, and burned the savannas to keep them clear of invading trees. A thousand years ago their society was at its height. Their villages and towns were spacious, formal and guarded by moats and palisades. In Erickson\u2019s hypothetical reconstruction, as many as a million people may have walked the causeways of eastern Bolivia in their long cotton tunics, heavy ornaments dangling from their wrists.\nSome believe that the prehistoric structures of the Beni were constructed by the Paititi tribe 5500 years ago, and that this ancient Beni civilization was the source of the popular Spanish legends of the rainforest El Dorado known as Gran Paititi.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4185, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8751255-2ab2-495a-8619-6c4d2bf09124": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8751255-2ab2-495a-8619-6c4d2bf09124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "317", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82af4d5c-b4ed-4432-9645-c73770398779", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "317", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "411c497f2719c5bd6721dc7fa1cba4d9ae09ce448b9565e6b353e184c70a050a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13254cf5-d86e-4375-adcb-5ce05dd7b52d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "317", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "0a7e338d2c14e4c93b2a0633608e5651c87fa33fa5fe4f147a5da33a8b12399e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These people built up the mounds for homes and farms, constructed the causeways and canals for transporta-tion and communication, created the fish weirs to feed themselves, and burned the savannas to keep them clear of invading trees.

Archaeologists continue their research into this fascinating part of history, but one thing is for sure: once you know what lies here in terms of world history, you\u2019ll never look at the forests of the Beni in the same way again.\n18-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   31718-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   317 9/12/09   17:44:219/12/09   17:44:21", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3373, "end_char_idx": 4514, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d460db3e-0d7b-4d58-8e9b-51383dc89973": {"__data__": {"id_": "d460db3e-0d7b-4d58-8e9b-51383dc89973", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "318", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "199e21e8-9274-4775-aea9-b4495881a4ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "318", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "679902d8c6dff83d448a2cffc46eb9eaa20c60de4cd9f28e8fb141446624822e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0010bb2-19e4-4923-a0dc-56a44cb61e03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70511ae5ecc32b6e7e04cc60de1d25dbb5982241d4a1ea4bc6cff12e517392b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AMAZON BASIN318   EASTERN BOLIVIAN AMAZON  \u2022\u2022  Reserva de Vida Silvestre R\u00edos Blanco y Negro  \nSanta Cruz.

It is home to a broad spec-trum of Amazonian flora and fauna and has a wide range of dwindling habitats, from open cerrado  to dense rainforest, lending it world-\nclass ecological significance and making it a fabulous place to explore. \nThere is an abundance of animals that can \nbe spotted here. The rivers hide alligators, caimans, pink river dolphins and rare giant otters, and peccaries, jaguars, tapirs and spider monkeys come to the riverbanks to drink in the evenings. Among the globally threatened mammals that you may dream of seeing are bush dogs and short-eared dogs.\nBirdwatchers are in for a serious treat. \nYou might glimpse any of these: the rusty-necked piculet, Zimmer\u2019s tody tyrant, collared crescent-chest, ocellated crake, rufous-winged antshrike, rufous-sided pygmy tyrant, campo miner, yellow-billed blue finch, black and tawny seed-eater and a host of others.\nThe park lies in the northernmost reaches \nof Santa Cruz department, between the banks of the R\u00edos Verde, Guapor\u00e9 (R\u00edo It\u00e9nez on Bolivian maps) and Paragu\u00e1. It encom-passes more than 1.5 million hectares of the most dramatic scenery in northern Bolivia, including rivers, rainforests, waterfalls, plateaus and rugged 500m escarpments.\nHistory\nOriginally known as Parque Nacional Huanchaca, this lovely park was created in 1979 to protect the wildlife of the Serran\u00eda de Huanchaca. Many of the people living around the fringes are descended from rubber tappers who arrived here dur-ing the 1940s. When synthetic rubber was developed, their jobs disappeared and they turned to hunting, agriculture, logging and the illegal pet trade.For a day visit, including admission, a \nthree-hour cruise and a meal, the price is B$425; to stay overnight it\u2019s B$850. Package tours booked in Trinidad may work out a bit cheaper. Further information is available from Lorena or Efr\u00e9m Hinojoso  \n(% 462-1968) , or \ntravel agencies in Trinidad.\nUnless you organize a tour, which will \ninclude transportation, you\u2019ll have to nego-tiate with a moto-taxi driver. The road isn\u2019t great, so you\u2019ll have to be very persuasive and expect to be charged a bit more than usual. It\u2019s also a good destination for those who\u2019ve rented motorbikes. If you\u2019re not staying, exotic dishes are available in the restaurant; the food is great but pricey.\nRESERVA DE VIDA SILVESTRE R\u00cdOS \nBLANCO Y NEGRO \nThis 1.4-million-hectare reserve, created in \n1990, occupies the heart of Bolivia\u2019s largest wilderness area and contains vast tracts of undisturbed rainforest and cerrado  with \nmyriad species of plants and animals. These include giant anteaters, peccaries, tapirs, jaguars, bush dogs, marmosets, river otters, capuchin monkeys, caimans, squirrel mon-keys, deer and capybaras. The diverse bird life includes curassows, six varieties of macaw and hundreds of other bird species.\nThe area\u2019s only settlement, the privately \nowned estancia (ranch), Perseverancia, is \n350km north of Santa Cruz.

Note that services here are very basic. There are two albergues  (basic guesthouses) with shared \nrooms, no shower and no drinking water. At the time of writing one of the hostels had been left roofless for some time following a storm. Check on local conditions before setting out.\nCamping is restricted to designated sites. \nWildlife is abundant around the river: you\u2019re likely to see river otters, howler monkeys, black caimans and dozens of bird species.\nTo enter the park you can hike 40km \nthrough the forest along the old logging road, rent a mountain bike or hire a 4WD taxi (B$700; April to December only). The community also offers trained local guides who charge around B$150 per day. If you decide to hike, allow two days and carry plenty of water.\nCampamento Los Fierros\nLos Fierros is a good staging point for jaunts around the southern end of the park, lying in the high Amazonian forest, 2km from the ecological habitat known as \u2018seasonally inundated termite savanna\u2019 (that is, plains dotted with termite mounds). Nearby hikes include trips to Laguna Chaplin  and Catarata El \nEncanto  and steep climbs up onto the wild \nHuanchaca Plateau .\nThere\u2019s superb birdwatching along the \nforested roads near Los Fierros, and a nearby creek for cooling off in or watch-ing fish-eating bats at night. An early morning visit to the termite savanna will frequently yield glimpses of rare wildlife: maned wolves, crab-eating foxes and even the odd jaguar.\nAt the time of writing, the accommo-\ndations at Los Fierros were in bad condition and accessible only on foot and during the dry season, though work was beginning to improve access. If you arrange your trip in advance, somebody from the community will come to meet you, but you will need to carry and prepare all your own food and be available to accompany travelers on their visit. Visit www.parquenoelkempff.com for an excellent overview of what makes the park so special and for details about the park\u2019s ongoing, award-winning Climate Action carbon sequestration program.\nUnless you go it alone, the only way to \nvisit the park is by organizing a tour with one of the Santa Cruz\u2013based tour compa-nies (p268).\nDangers & Annoyances\nPredictably, you\u2019ll need to guard your-self against the park\u2019s most populous and varied creatures: bichos  (insects). During \nrainy periods, the mosquitoes are fierce and voracious and tiny garrapatillas  (ticks) can \nbe especially annoying. In the wet season, be particularly wary of blood-sucking sand-flies, which carry leishmaniasis. These flies are a real pest at some campsites, particularly in the high forest around the Huanchaca I laboratory ruins.\nBetween September and December there\u2019s \na phenomenal bee hatch-out, when the bees seek out human campsites for salt. At such times it\u2019s not unusual to have as many as 10,000 bees hanging around a single site so, if you\u2019re allergic, avoid the park dur-ing these months. The best way to avoid attract ing such numbers is to change camp-sites daily.\nLeafcutter ants can also be problematic \nand although their 6in-wide forest high-ways \u2013 jammed with lines of leaf-bearing workers \u2013 can be fascinating to watch, they also often attack the rip-stop nylon of tents. They line their nests with the leaves, which produce fungus for food, and by confusing nylon for leaves the ants do double dam-age: they can destroy your tent in less than an hour \u2013 even while you\u2019re sleeping in it \u2013 and lose their precious food by lining their nests with plastic.

Never cook or even camp in grassland habitat, no matter how flat and inviting, and never leave a cooking fire unattended, even in the forest.\n18-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   Sec1:320 18-amazon-basin-bol7.indd   Sec1:320 8/12/09   09:23:54 8/12/09   09:23:54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3288, "end_char_idx": 4454, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08128cd1-2628-4377-92d5-de5141144b16": {"__data__": {"id_": "08128cd1-2628-4377-92d5-de5141144b16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce690c19-181a-4555-9935-33f97dc01345", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "fb68c47c532e0a56ac5c64913eba01020bf7300e66ee546e6259b0bf15496a25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14582aac-9b16-40f8-ba4d-e61019a90095", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83cf4385eb85fc729dfd31653c305955fc5303beb66aaae815363abe3d10d37e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "lonelyplanet.comAMAZON BASINEASTERN BOLIVIAN AMAZON  \u2022\u2022  Parque Nacional Noel Kempff Mercado   321\nand the gallery forests of the R\u00edo Bajo \nParagu\u00e1 from the escarpment. It\u2019s also a good vantage point to watch hawks and vultures riding the thermals and flocks of blue and yellow macaws migrating between their nesting sites in the highland palm groves and their feeding grounds in the forests below.\nOn the plateau you can hike for two or \nthree days north to a spectacular unnamed  \nwaterfall  or south to the escarpment over-\nlooking the Catarata El Encanto. Along the way watch for the endangered gama  (white-\ntailed deer), which has its last stronghold here. You\u2019ll also pass numerous crystalline \nponds  that make for refreshing swimming \nholes; at least one species of fish here is found nowhere else on earth. Although it may nip at your legs, it\u2019s not dangerous.\nThose with adequate financial resources \ncan fly into one of two remote airstrips at the abandoned drug-processing labora   -tories Huanchaca I  and Las Gamas , beautiful \nplaces at the southern end of the escarp-ment. The former lies on the northern end of the plateau amid cerrado  savanna \ndotted with islands of Amazonian forest. From there it\u2019s a short day hike to the upper reaches of the R\u00edo Paucerna , which is a fast-\nrunning blackwater river. Strong swimmers will be OK, but drag yourself out before you reach the Arco Ir\u00eds waterfall !\nFlor de Oro\nHere you\u2019ll find examples of periodically \ninundated savanna, degraded cerrado  and \nriverine flooded forests, all of which afford superb birdwatching opportunities. More than 300 bird species have been recorded here, and sightings of pink river dolphins are almost guaranteed. It\u2019s a 30-minute motorboat ride or a four-hour hike upstream to Lago Caim\u00e1n , predictably a superb spot \nto see caimans. The lagoon is the trailhead for Allie\u2019s Trail , which climbs up through dry \nforest to the Mirador de los Monos for great \nscenery along the edges of the escarpment.\nTwo spectacular waterfalls  tumble down \nthe R\u00edo Paucerna above the Campamento Boca de Paucerna ranger station. From December to late June, the boat trip from Flor de Oro to the rustic Campamento Ahlfeld  \ntakes about five hours each way, depend-ing on water levels. From the campamento  \n(camping grounds)  it\u2019s an easy 30-minute \nwalk to the spectacular 35m Catarata Ahlfeld  drinking water. There are no cooking facili-\nties and no showers for visitors. Prices for camping and guides are negotiated locally. \nCATARATA EL ENCANTO\nThe spectacular 150m waterfall  that spills \noff the Serran\u00eda de Huanchaca is the main objective of most visitors to Los Fierros, making for an enchanting three-day hike. With a mountain bike, it\u2019s a long and tiring day trip; with a vehicle, it can be done in a day, with lots of time for stops along the way.\nThe excursion begins along the 4WD \ntrack that heads east from Los Fierros. Along the way you\u2019ll pass through high Amazo-nian forest, seasonally inundated termite savanna and the threatened cerrado .\nOnce you\u2019ve crossed the savanna area, \ncontinue until you reach a fork in the road; take the left fork. This abandoned logging road passes through some attractive forest, and you\u2019re almost guaranteed to see \u2013 or at least hear \u2013 spider monkeys.\nEventually you\u2019ll reach a brook with \npotable water. Here the logging road ends and you follow a trail running alongside the stream to the foot of the waterfall. Camping is allowed along the stream below the trailhead, but not along the trails to the water fall.

For La Florida, get off at La Mechita, a wide spot in the road 55km west. This is a popular route so book well in advance.\nIf you\u2019re traveling this route, it\u2019s wise to \nspeak with the SERNAP office in San Ignacio to see if a 4WD taxi can meet you in La Mechita. Alternatively, you can try to hitch a ride with the park rangers or a passing logging truck. \nAnother option is to take any bus between \nSanta Cruz and San Ignacio de Velasco and get off at Santa Rosa de la Roca. After you\u2019ve secured a good supply of food and drink, find the restaurant El Carretero, five min-utes\u2019 walk from Santa Rosa de la Roca along the road toward San Ignacio, and look for a cami\u00f3n  headed north toward La Mechita. \nIf you\u2019re unsuccessful, you can always stay overnight in Santa Rosa, which has several alojamientos . \nAt La Mechita you\u2019ll find a couple of \nalojamientos  but, with luck, your cami\u00f3n  \nmay be passing La Florida turnoff, 20km away, where it\u2019s possible to camp. From the turnoff you\u2019ll probably have to walk the remaining 35km to La Florida. After 34km from the turnoff, turn right and continue the last kilometer into the village. It\u2019s pos-sible to camp here. On the next day, register at the park rangers\u2019 office and embark on the 40km hike to Los Fierros.\nCAR \nIt\u2019s not generally advisable to visit the park on your own unless you\u2019re familiar with the area, since many underestimate the tough conditions. Regardless, you will need to rent a 4WD (US$75 to US$100 per day) in Santa Cruz. From Santa Cruz it takes at least 14 hours to reach Los Fierros, so most people take two days for the trip, spending the night in Concepci\u00f3n en route.\nTO BRAZIL\nA more radical alternative is the Brazilian connection to Flor de Oro. After picking up a visa in Santa Cruz, take a bus to San Mat\u00edas (on the Brazilian border) and then on to C\u00e1ceres, four hours into Brazil. From there catch another bus to Vilhena (with a federal police post for entrance stamps) in the southern part of Rond\u00f4nia state. From there daily buses leave for the village of Pimenteiras, 25 minutes by boat downstream and its lovely swimming hole. The more adventurous can hike four hours beyond to the fabulous Catarata Arco Iris .\nAccessed via private-contracted flights \nthat arrive at the airstrip, visits are currently permitted only when accompanied by a tour company. The once-excellent accom mo da-tion facilities have deteriorated considerably, but work to improve them was scheduled to begin at the time of writing. Check the current situation before setting out.\nGetting There & Away\nAIR\nThe easiest \u2013 and most expensive \u2013 way into the park is by contracting a private aerotaxi . \nRound-trip charter flights for up to five passengers from Santa Cruz cost US$1200 to Los Fierros (two hours) and US$1300 to Flor de Oro (2\u00be hours) and are the major costs of package tours.\nBOAT\nFrom the pleasant little Bolivian village of Piso Firme (which has several humble alojamientos  and restaurants as well as a small \nstore selling staples), there\u2019s an infrequent barge service upriver to Pimenteiras, Brazil (12 hours). From there it\u2019s a 30-minute boat ride upstream to Flor de Oro. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to negotiate a rented motorboat (up to US$200 one way) or, failing that, swim! There\u2019s also a fair amount of Brazilian cargo transportation along the R\u00edos Mamor\u00e9 and Guapor\u00e9 between Guajar\u00e1-Mirim and Costa Marques, in the Brazilian state of Rond\u00f4nia.

The road from Riberalta to Guayaramer\u00edn is a high-speed gravel track, and taxis (B$40, 1\u00bd hours) ply the route, leaving when full from the bus terminal. Buses (B$20, 2\u00bd hours) are cheaper but slower \u2013 they depart in the morning.\nAll flotas  between Guayaramer\u00edn and \nCobija (B$120, 12 hours), and the hor-rendously uncomfortable route via Rure-nabaque (B$170, 17 to 40 hours) to La Paz (B$280, 35 to 60 hours), stop at Riberalta. Several flotas also go to Trinidad (B$280, 17 \nhours) daily, though the road may be closed during the wet season \u2013 it\u2019s easier to fly.\nGetting Around\nMoto-taxis (day/night B$3.50/5) will take you anywhere. With a driver\u2019s license from home, you can rent motorbikes (B$15/80 per hour/per day) from taxistas (taxi driv-\ners) at the corner of Nicol\u00e1s Su\u00e1rez and Gabriel Ren\u00e9 Moreno.Sleeping\nRiberalta doesn\u2019t see that many visitors so hotel prices are high and you should not expect value for money.\nResidencial Los Reyes  \n(% 852-2628; s/d B$20/30)  \nClose to the airport, this is a basic choice with a lovely, cool, garden courtyard.

Unfortunately, the rooms themselves lack the same charm and some are just musty and old. Choose carefully.\nEating\nRiberalta\u2019s specialty is its famous nuez del \nBrasil (Brazil nuts), which are roasted in sugar and cinnamon and sold at the bus terminals and airport for B$10 per packet.

Unfortunately, better access means more logging and the region has now been opened up to indiscriminate exploitation of its natural resources with large tracts of virgin rainforest being cleared at a fright-ening rate.\nThe journey requires two major balsa  \ncrossings, the first at Pe\u00f1a Amarilla, two hours outside Riberalta crossing the R\u00edo \nBeni. On the western bank, you can find stands \nselling empanadas and other snacks. \nThe most interesting crossing on the \ntrip, however, traverses the R\u00edo Madre de \nDios. From the eastern port, the 45-minute \ncrossing begins with a 500m cruise along a backwater tributary onto the great river itself. Along the way listen for the intriguing jungle chorus that characterizes this part of the country.\nThe crossing of the R\u00edo Orthon , at Puerto \nRico, is by bridge. From Puerto Rico to Cobija, development has been particularly rampant. The scene is one of charred giants, a forest of stumps and smouldering bush; when something is burning, the sun is like an egg yolk through the dense smoke.\nCOBIJA\npop 32,000 / elevation 140m\nCapital of the Pando and Bolivia\u2019s wettest (1770mm of precipitation annually) and most humid spot, Cobija sits on a sharp bend of the R\u00edo Acre.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3625, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed32921f-513c-4f46-b227-5d32ab78dccc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed32921f-513c-4f46-b227-5d32ab78dccc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "326", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81c1366d-5bf3-4d74-8ff0-5a36285a70c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "326", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "b47ac2eda17b4e903f23ef856289ab7b0c690139193bcdc369657058e52b6898", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74734332-a4a1-444f-9ac6-8a518d46ef3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "326", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "cc855f0389b82257ff32d04a860b808809b7900d8d33cc3f6d77115e4b736f15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The most interesting crossing on the \ntrip, however, traverses the R\u00edo Madre de \nDios.

Day visits are encouraged, and you don\u2019t even need a visa. Lanchas  (B$10) across \nthe river leave from the port every half an hour from 6am to 6pm, and sporadically through the night. To travel further into Brazil or to enter Bolivia, you\u2019ll have to complete border formalities.

Entry/exit stamps are available \nat immigration in Cobija and from Brasil\u00e9ia\u2019s Pol\u00edcia Federal. With some negotiation, taxis will take you to the Pol\u00edcia Federal in Brasil\u00e9ia, wait while you clear immigration, then take you on to the center or to the bus terminal. Alternatively, take the lancha  (B$5) across the R\u00edo Acre; from \nthere it\u2019s another 1.5km to the Pol\u00edcia Federal  \n(h 8am-noon & 2-5pm) . \nAlthough officials don\u2019t always check, technically everyone needs to have a yellow-fever \nvaccination certificate to enter Brazil.

Be aware that with the exception of the international hotel chains, the star ratings for hotels are not based on the recognized international rating system. \nThe Bolivian hotel-rating system divides \naccommodations into posadas, alojamien-\ntos, residenciales, casas de hu\u00e9spedes,  hostales  \nand hoteles. This subjective zero- to five-star \nrating system reflects the price scale and, to some extent, the quality. (Note that hos tales are not necessarily hostels as you might normally think; some are in fact upmarket hotels.) Rock-bottom places are usually found around the bus and train stations.\nPrices in this book reflect high-sea-\nson rates (late May to early September). Room availability is only a problem during fiestas (especially Carnaval in Oruro), when prices double, and at popular week-end getaways. \nThe accommodations sections in this book \nare organized into budget, midrange and top-end categories. Budget typically means less than B$80 per person per night with a shared bathroom (exceptions are noted). Midrange is usually between B$80 and B$220 per person (mostly with private bathroom and breakfast). The top-end tag is applied to places charging more than B$220 per person; some can fetch upwards of B$700 per night. In La Paz prices are higher (mid-range is considered anything between B$90 and B$280 per person). We\u2019ve noted which accommodations include bathrooms in the quoted price.\nAlways ask to see a couple of rooms \nbefore committing.\nCamping\nBolivia offers excellent camping, especially along trekking routes and in remote moun-tain areas. Gear (of varying quality) is easily rented in La Paz and at popular trekking base camps like Sorata. There are few or-ganized campsites, but you can pitch a tent almost any where outside population cent-ers, although it\u2019s always a good idea to ask for permission if possible. Remember that highland nights are often freezing.

Most alojamientos  (B$15 to B$35 \nper person) have communal bathrooms with electric showers (to avoid electric shock, don\u2019t touch the shower while the water is running and wear rubber sandals). Most travelers end up at residenciales,  \nwhich charge B$60 to B$140 for a double with private bathroom, about 30% less without. C asas de hu\u00e9spedes  (family-run \nguesthouses) sometimes offer a more mid-range, B&B-like atmosphere. \nWarning: several readers have alerted \nus to improper use of propane heaters in Bolivia. These are sometimes offered in cheaper accommodations but are not meant to be used in enclosed spaces so refrain from using them if supplied. \nACTIVITIES\nWant to get the heart pumping and the lungs gasping? Bolivia offers a smorgasbord of activities for the adventure-seeker: from mountaineering to horseback riding, sin-gle-track mountain-bike rides to climbing. Hiking and trekking are arguably the most rewarding Bolivian activities; the country and assaults have been reported in some areas \u2013 always inquire locally about security before heading off to set up camp.\nHostels\nHostelling International (HI; www.hostellingbolivia.org)  \nis affiliated with a network of 16 accom-modations in different parts of Bolivia. A typical of other \u2018hosteling\u2019 networks, mem-bers range from two-star hotels to camping places, but few offer traditional amenities like dorm beds or shared kitchens. HI membership cards may be for sale at the flagship hostel in Sucre (p218), although rumor has it that some HI locations are yet to learn about offering the 10% discount to members. \nFor affordable accommodations, check \nout www.boliviahostels.com.\nHostales & Hotels\nBolivia has pleasant midrange places and five-star luxury resorts, although these are generally limited to the larger cities and popular vacation and weekend resort des-tinations. Standard hotel amenities include breakfast, private bathrooms with 24/7 hot showers (gas- or electric-heated), phones and color TV, usually with cable. Where they exist, luxury accommodations are quite a bargain (compared to their international counterparts).PRACTICALITIES\n\u0084 Use the metric system for weights and measures \u2013 except when buying produce at street \nmarkets, where everything is sold in libras  (pounds; 1lb = 0.45kg).\n\u0084 Buy or watch videos on the VHS system.\n\u0084 Most electricity currents are 220V AC, at 50Hz. Most plugs and sockets are the two-pin, \nround-prong variety, but a few anomalous American-style two-pin, parallel flat-pronged sockets exist.\n\u0084 Most locals take their coca tea or cafecito  (\u2018little\u2019 coffee) with La Raz\u00f3n (www.la-razon.com, in \nSpanish),  the nation\u2019s biggest daily newspaper. In Sucre seek out El Correo del Sur \n(www.correodelsur.com, in Spanish); in Santa Cruz, El Deber . International periodicals are sold \nat Los Amigos del Libro outlets in bigger cities.\n\u0084 In La Paz, tune in to noncommercial 96.5FM (Radio Top) for folk tunes or 100.5FM for a catchy \nEnglish\u2013Spanish pop mix. In Cochabamba, Radio Latina 97.3FM spins a lively blend of Andean folk, salsa and rock. For a 24/7 stream of Andean artists, browse Bolivia Web Radio  \n(www.boliviaweb.com/\nradio) . Radio Panamericana  (www.panamericana-bolivia.com, in Spanish)  is popular all around Bolivia. \n\u0084 Switch on the TV to watch the government-run Canal 7 or the private ATB TV network. Oppo-\nsition to the government is shown on UNITEL out of Santa Cruz. Cable TV with international stations is available in most upmarket hotels. \n19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   329 19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   329 8/12/09   09:30:21 8/12/09   09:30:21", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3920, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f575820e-8c56-4875-878c-a3f710d06e18": {"__data__": {"id_": "f575820e-8c56-4875-878c-a3f710d06e18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "330", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d996e79-c6fa-4f12-865d-c65856767710", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "330", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "55e813f26baecb0b36ba75b8ea610bbc0d4980a339dbf2dcb5e5bd83d34ee7ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DIRECTORYlonelyplanet.com 330   DIRECTORY  \u2022\u2022  Business Hours\nmodern supermarkets in big cities, as are \ndisposable diapers.\nThere is a fantastic children\u2019s museum in \nSucre (p216) and a water park in Santa Cruz (p268), but most Bolivians spend Sunday afternoons picnicking with the family in parks and zoos or strolling the traffic-less Prados of La Paz and Cochabamba.\nFor more information, advice and anec-\ndotes, see Lonely Planet\u2019s Travel with Children . \nCLIMATE CHARTS\nThe following climate charts provide an indication of temperature and rainfall around the country. Note that for La Paz, the airport (where temperature rates are recorded) is 400m higher than the city center, so official temperature recordings are around 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) cooler than those experienced on the street.

Alterna-tively, you can absorb archaeological sites, slide across the salt plains in a 4WD, soak in a hot spring or visit vineyards. For more, see the Outdoors chapter, p54.\nBUSINESS HOURS \nUsual business hours are listed inside the front cover. Exceptions to these have been noted in individual listings in this book. Few businesses open before 9am, though markets stir as early as 6am and some are open on Sunday mornings. Banks are open between 9am and 4pm on weekdays (Banco de Cr\u00e9dito is open till 6pm); in smaller towns, they close for lunch. Cities virtually shut down between noon and 3pm, except markets and restaurants serving lunch-hour crowds. Hours between eateries vary \u2013 this book indicates where restaurants and cafes are open for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. If you have urgent business to attend to, don\u2019t wait until the weekend as most offices will be closed.\nCHILDREN\nFew foreigners visit Bolivia with children, but those who do are usually treated with great kindness; Bolivians love babies and having children in tow will do wonders in breaking down cultural barriers.\nCivilian airlines allow children under the \nage of 12 to fly at a reduced rate (currently 67% of the full fare); children below the age of two pay only 10% of the adult fare. On long-distance buses, those who occupy a seat will normally have to pay the full fare. Most hotels have family rooms with three or four beds. Restaurants rarely advertise children\u2019s portions, but will often offer a child-sized serving at a lower price, or will allow two kids to share an adult meal. \nSafety seats, diaper-changing facilities \nand child-care services are only available in the finest hotels. Breastfeeding in public is widespread. Formula milk is available in \n19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   33019-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   330 9/12/09   17:47:299/12/09   17:47:29", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3071, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7e08c13-abeb-420f-98c2-bc1fb54b89f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7e08c13-abeb-420f-98c2-bc1fb54b89f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "331", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c887d50-eea0-44df-b799-b0e03d53056c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "331", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "f2accd49812d76c5d326503f2eb09abce346c9f911620e210a3e9302eb5d25fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41d6c485-116d-4e7d-b9b0-c22299f3bfd3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08fa2cee3a74cc50e4cfda4520124aa4b9a71b52679d9603fb072efc370d1df2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DIRECTORYlonelyplanet.com DIRECTORY  \u2022\u2022  Customs Regulations   331\nDISCOUNT CARDS\nThe International Student Travel Confederation \n(ISTC; www.istc.org) is an international network \nof specialist student travel organizations. \nIt\u2019s also the body behind the International Student Identity Card (ISIC), which gives carriers discounts on a few services in Bolivia.

Generally speaking, your embassy won\u2019t be much help in emergencies if the trouble you\u2019re in is re-motely your own fault. Remember that while in Bolivia you are bound by Bolivian laws. Your embassy will not be sympathetic if you end up in jail after committing a crime locally, even if such actions are legal in your own country.\nIn genuine emergencies you might get \nsome assistance, but only if other channels have been exhausted. For example, if you need to get home urgently, a free ticket home is exceedingly unlikely \u2013 the embassy would expect you to have insurance. If you have all your money and documents stolen, embassy staff might assist with getting a new passport, but a loan for onward travel is out of the question.\nFor a full list of foreign diplomatic rep-\nresentation in Bolivia, see www.embassies abroad.com/embassies-in/Bolivia.Argentina \nLa Paz (Map pp62-3; % 2-241-7737, \nfax 2-242-2727; Aspiazu 497); Cochabamba (Map p192; \n% 4-425-5859, fax 4-422-9347; Federico Blanco 929);  \nVillaz\u00f3n (% 2-596-5253; Saavedra 311); Santa Cruz (Map \npp264-5; % 3-334-7133, fax 3-334-8200; Jun\u00edn 22);  Tarija \n(Map p246; % 4-664-4273; Bol\u00edvar 696)\nAustralia  La Paz (Map pp62-3; % 2-211-5655, 242-\n2957; Aspiazu 416)\nBrazil  La Paz (% 2-216-6400, fax 2-244-0043; www\n.brasil.org.bo; Arce, Edificio Multicentro); Cochabamba \n(Map p192; % 4-425-5860, fax 4-411-7084; Avenida \nOquendo N-1080); Guayaramer\u00edn ( % 3-855-3766, fax \n3-855-4695; 24 de Septiembre 28);  Santa Cruz (Map pp264-\n5; % 3-334-4400, fax 3-335-0488; Germ\u00e1n Busch 330);  \nSucre (Map pp212-3; % 4-645-2661; Arenales 212)\nCanada La Paz (Map pp62-3; % 2-241-5141, \nfax 2-241-4453; 2nd fl, Victor Sanjin\u00e9s 2678)\nChile  La Paz (% 2-279-7331, fax 2-212-6491; \nwww.cgchilelapaz.com.bo; Calle 14 N 8024, Calacoto);  \nSanta Cruz ( % 3-343-4272; www.consulado-chile.scz.com; \n9th fl, Edificio Torre Equipetrol)CUSTOMS REGULATIONS\nWhen entering Bolivia you can bring in \nmost articles duty-free provided you can convince customs that they are for personal use.

See p67 for a detailed run-down of en vogue  cons.\nThere is a strong tradition of social pro-\ntest in Bolivia: demonstrations are a regular occurrence and this can affect travelers. While generally peaceful, they can turn threatening in nature at times: agitated protestors throw stones and rocks and police occasionally use force and tear gas to disperse crowds. Bloqueos (roadblocks) and strikes \nby transportation workers often lead to long delays. Be careful using taxis during trans-portation strikes \u2013 you may end up at the receiving end of a rock, which people pelt at those who are not in sympathy with them. \nThe rainy season means flooding, land-\nslides and road washouts, which in turn means more delays. Getting stuck overnight behind a landslide can happen; you\u2019ll be a happier camper with ample food, drink and warm clothes on hand.\nNote that the mine tours in Potos\u00ed \n(p234) and the 4x4 excursions around Salar de Uyuni (p167) have become so hugely popular that agencies are willing to forgo safety.

You can often \nchange money in travel agencies, hotels and sometimes in stores selling touristy items. Cambistas  (street moneychangers) operate \nin most cities but only change cash dollars, paying roughly the same as casas de cambio . \nThey\u2019re convenient after hours, but guard against rip-offs and counterfeit notes. The rate for cash doesn\u2019t vary much from place to place, and there is no black-market rate. Currencies of neighboring countries may be exchanged in border areas and at casas de \ncambio  in La Paz. Beware, too, mangled notes: \nunless both halves of a repaired banknote bear identical serial numbers, the note is worthless. Also note that US$100 bills of the CB-B2 series are not accepted anywhere, neither are US$50 bills of the AB-B2 series.\nInternational Transfers\nThe fastest way to have money transferred from abroad is with Western Union  \n(www\n.westernunion.com) . A newer, alternative option \nis through Money Gram  (www.moneygram.com) , \nwhich has offices in all major cities \u2013 watch the hefty fees, though. Your bank can also wire money to a cooperating Bolivian bank; it may take a couple of business days.\nTraveler\u2019s Checks\nChanging traveler\u2019s checks in smaller towns is often impossible. You\u2019ll usually be charged a commission of up to 6% (slightly lower in La Paz) or a flat fee of US$6. American Express is the most widely ac-cepted brand, though with persistence you should be able to change other major brands. Make sure you bring your passport when changing traveler\u2019s checks.well) on Visa, MasterCard, Plus and Cirrus cards; note that in the past, many Europe-ans have reported trouble using their cards. In smaller towns, the local bank Prodem is a good option for cash advances on Visa and MasterCard (3% to 6% commission charged) and many branches are meant to be open on Saturday mornings; the hours and machines are unreliable. Don\u2019t rely on ATMs; always carry some cash with you, especially if venturing into rural areas.\nChange\nFinding change for bills larger than B$10 is a national pastime, as change for larger notes is scarce outside big cities. When exchanging money or making big purchases, request the cambio  (change) in small de-\nnominations. If you can stand the queues, most banks will break large bills. Also, check any larger bills for damage as you may not be able to change them if they\u2019re torn or taped together.\nCredit Cards & Cash Advances\nBrand-name plastic, such as Visa, Master-Card and (less often) American Express, may be used in larger cities at the better hotels, restaurants and tour agencies. Cash advances (according to your limit at home) are avail-able on Visa (and less often on MasterCard), with no commission, from most major bank branches. In smaller towns, the local Prodem bank is your best bet for Visa and MasterCard advances (it charges a 3% to 6% commission). Some travel agencies in towns without ATMs will provide cash ad-vances for clients for 3% to 6% commission. \nCurrency\nBolivia\u2019s unit of currency is the boliviano (B$), which is divided into 100 centavos . \nBolivianos come in 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 denomination notes, with coins worth 1, 2 and 5 bolivianos as well as 10, 20 and 50 centavos. Often called pesos (the currency was changed from pesos to bolivianos in 1987), bolivianos are extremely difficult to unload outside the country.  \nExchanging Money\nVisitors fare best with US dollars (travelers have reported that it\u2019s difficult to change euros).

Both currencies have experienced fluctu ations in recent years, so expect many figures to be different from what may be printed in the book. \n19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   335 19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   335 8/12/09   09:30:22 8/12/09   09:30:22", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3269, "end_char_idx": 4185, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6b17846-cc04-4c68-9de0-381166c10c8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6b17846-cc04-4c68-9de0-381166c10c8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "336", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86ec0697-1654-4802-844a-5f5d6662b570", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "336", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "bd8896682e6309aa632916f19578c8790b709c33c4087e9d4cf12ecc9780ef32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bef7f81d-bc7d-4bef-9634-f22d32c827ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a89d513c06f99279d4a851260f80c1dfc219103920f8c66f9d79006dbdb7c46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DIRECTORYlonelyplanet.com 336    DIRECTORY  \u2022\u2022  Photography & Video\nDeclaraci\u00f3n de Aduana and CP-71 Bolet\u00edn \nde Expedici\u00f3n). Take your parcel to the of-fice marked \u2018Encomiendas.\u2019 If your package is less than 2kg it\u2019s easier to send by regular mail. Pay the cost of postage and complete the CN-23. A 1kg parcel to the USA will cost B$150 by air and B$238 by faster cou-rier service.\nIn some cities, you might have your parcels \nchecked by customs at the post office; in cities without inhouse customs agents, you mayhave to trek across town to the aduana  (cus-\ntoms office). A parcel\u2019s chances of arriving at its destination are inversely proportional to its declared value, and to the number of \u2018inspections\u2019 to which it is subjected.\nPostal Rates\nAirmail postales  (postcards) or letters weigh-\ning up to 20g cost around B$7.50 to the USA, B$9 to Europe and B$10.50 to the rest of the world. Relatively reliable express-mail service is available for rates similar to those charged by private international couriers. \nReceiving Mail\nReliable free lista de correos  (poste restante)  \nis available in larger cities. Mail should be addressed to you c/o Lista de Correos (Poste Restante), Correo Central, La Paz (or what-ever city), Bolivia. Using only a first initial and capitalizing your entire LAST NAME will help avoid confusion. Mail is often sorted into foreign and Bolivian stacks, so those with Latin surnames should check the local stack as well as checking for your first name. La Paz holds poste restante  for \ntwo months. You will need your passport to collect the mail.\nSHOPPING\nEach town or region has its own specialty arte-\nsan\u00eda . For traditional musical instruments, \nhead for Tarija or Calle Sag\u00e1rnaga in La Paz (although the latter will be overpriced). For weavings, the Cordillera Apolobamba or the environs of Sucre are your best bet. Ceramics are a specialty around Cochabamba and crafts in tropical woods are sold in the lowlands around Santa Cruz, Trinidad and the Amazon Basin. \nYou\u2019ll find a range of reasonably priced \nartwork from all over the country in La Paz and Copacabana, but prices are generally  lower at the point of original production. PHOTOGRAPHY & VIDEO\nBolivian landscapes swallow film, so don\u2019t be caught without a healthy supply. Keep in mind, however, that the combination of high-altitude ultraviolet rays and light reflected off snow or water will conspire to fool both your eye and your light meter. \nA polarizing filter is essential when \nphotographing the Altiplano, and will help to reveal the dramatic effects of the exaggerated UV element at high altitude. In the lowlands, conditions include dim light, humidity, haze and leafy interference. For optimum shots you need either fast film or a tripod for long exposures.\nLa Paz is generally the best place to pick up \nfilm and for repairs; see p86. As always, avoid exposing your equipment to sand and water.\nPhotographing People\nWhile some Bolivians are willing photo subjects, others may be superstitious about your camera, suspicious of your motives or interested in payment. Many children will ask for payment, often after you\u2019ve taken their photo. It\u2019s best to err on not taking such shots in the first place \u2013 be sensitive to the wishes of locals. Ask permission to photograph if a candid shot can\u2019t be made; if permission is denied, you should neither insist nor snap a picture.\nPOST\nEven the smallest towns have post offices \u2013 some are signposted \u2018Ecobol\u2019 (Empresa Correos de Bolivia). From major towns, the post is generally reliable (although often involving long delays), but when posting anything important, it\u2019s better to pay extra to have it registered or send it by courier.

It\u2019s generally safe to catch a lift on a cami\u00f3n  (flatbed truck) if you see lots of other \npeople waiting; don\u2019t get on board if anything seems fishy. Women should never hitch-hike alone. Especially in urban areas and at night, women \u2013 even in groups \u2013 should be careful, and avoid isolation. Hiking alone is discouraged under any circumstances. See also Women Travelers, p340.\nTELEPHONE \nNumerous carriers \u2013 such as Entel, Viva, Boliviatel, Cotel and Tigo \u2013 offer local and long-distance rates on both landlines and cellular phones. Bolivia\u2019s first company, Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (Entel), is still the most prevalent in smaller towns but other companies are making an entrance. Local calls cost just a few bolivia-nos from these offices. Puntos,  run by all \nof the above companies,  are small, privately \nrun outposts offering similar services and are open late. Alternatively, street kiosks are often equipped with telephones that charge B$1 for brief local calls. \nIn some tiny villages you\u2019ll find card-\nphone telephone boxes \u2013 phones take both magnetic and computer chip varieties. Both card types (tarjetas)  come in denomina-\ntions of B$10, B$20, B$50 and B$100. Touts in fluorescent jackets with cellular phones chained to themselves offer calls for B$1 per minute. All sorts of clothing are available in llama and alpaca wool; wool from vicu\u00f1as is the finest and most expensive. Some pieces are hand-dyed and woven or knitted while others are mass-produced by machine.\nMany articles are made by cooperatives \nor profit companies with ecofriendly and culturally responsible practices. See shop-ping in La Paz (p85) for more.\nSOLO TRAVELERS\nAs always when traveling, safety is in num-bers; solo travelers should remain alert when traveling, especially at night. On the whole, however, the benefits of solo travel can be huge, as being alone often opens up many doors to meeting local people as well as other travelers. \nOn the well-trodden gringo circuit, solo \ntravelers should have little trouble meeting up with others. Some hostels and hotels have notice boards for those wanting to form groups to do activities. In places like Uyuni, it\u2019s relatively easy to meet other travelers around town to make up the numbers. \nHostel prices are often based on a per-\nperson rate, although more upmarket hotels have separate prices for single and double, with the latter being more economical.\nThe recent increase in tourism to Bolivia \nhas meant that locals are becoming more accustomed to seeing Western travelers, including unaccompanied women. This has significantly reduced the incidence of sexual harassment and the concept of the \u2018loose gringa,\u2019 but in some places you may still face unwanted attention.TOP BOLIVIAN SOUVENIRS\n\u0084 Chulla  \u2013 this traditional hat has got \u2018I\u2019ve been to South America\u2019 written all over it.\n\u0084 Irupana chocolate \u2013 buy top-quality, organic chocolate for US$0.15 per bar (p86)? \n\u0084 Wall hanging \u2013 the best hail from the Jalq\u2019a region around Sucre (p223).\n\u0084 Bowler hat \u2013 these go for only B$40 in the section of market along Max Paredes, La Paz. \n\u0084 Ekeko figure \u2013 this little lucky man of abundance (see boxed text, p77) may look after you, \nwhether a silver trinket or larger ornament.\n\u0084 Sampa\u00f1a  or charango  \u2013 take a stroll and a strum in Sag\u00e1rnaga for some top-quality musical \ninstruments (see p38 and p86).\n\u0084 Alpaca and llama designer wear \u2013 go animal and kit yourself out in some stunning \ninternational fashions with a local touch (p86).\n\u0084 Wine \u2013 connoisseurs rate La Concepci\u00f3n as up there with the world\u2019s best (p253). \n19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   337 19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   337 8/12/09   09:30:22 8/12/09   09:30:22", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3918, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d0788ba-ca3a-4b35-8178-6687fbeca911": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d0788ba-ca3a-4b35-8178-6687fbeca911", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "338", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "159a6a74-da12-48b4-9aa2-f698392e9385", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "338", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "dc0cc5ff0ed92f02676ccfe0e8191fcd0db94595b6b3edd17abe97f4cf5ce7d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DIRECTORYlonelyplanet.com 338    DIRECTORY  \u2022\u2022  Telephone\nPhone Codes\nThe boxed text below has detailed instruc-\ntions on making calls. \nIn this book, when the given phone \nnumber is in another city or town (eg some rural hotels have La Paz reservation num-bers), the single-digit telephone code is provided along with the number. \nInternational Calls\nBolivia\u2019s country code is %591. The in-\nternational direct-dialing access code is 00. Cellular SIM cards are cheap (starting at \nB$40, inclusive of B$20\u2013B$30 credit) and available from larger carrier outlets as well as small private phone shops. If you buy from a private outlet, activate the number and check that the phone works before purchasing. Make sure your phone has tri-band network capabilities (similar to the US system). To top up your call amount, buy cards (ask for cr\u00e9dito,  ie \ncredit) from the numerous puntos  in any \ncity or town. \nDIALING IN TO THE TELEPHONE NETWORK\nEven Bolivians struggle with their own telephone network, thanks to the recent changes in \nthe system. With patience, dialing is easy once you get your head \u2013 and ears \u2013 around it. The following should help you tap into the network.\nNumbers for l\u00edneas fijas  (landlines) have seven digits; cellular numbers have eight digits.\nNumerous telecommunications carriers include, among others, Entel, Cotel, Tigo, Boliviatel \nand Viva. Each carrier has an individual code between 010 and 021.\nEach department (region) has its own single-digit area code which must be used when \ndialing from another region or to another city, regardless of whether it\u2019s the same area code as the one you\u2019re in. The department codes are: (2) La Paz, Oruro, Potos\u00ed; (3) Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando; (4) Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Tarija.\nPublic phone booths and phone boxes\nDialing landlines from public phone booths is easy; ask the cashier for advice. To make a call to another landline within the same city, simply dial the seven-digit number . If you\u2019re calling another \nregion, dial 0 plus the single-digit area code followed by the seven-digit number, eg 02-123-4567. \nIf calling a cell phone, ask the cashier for instructions; most puntos  have different phones for calls \nto cellulars and landlines, so you may have to swap cabins if calling both.\nPrivate landlines\nIf dialing from landline to landline within the same city , dial the seven-digit number. If dialing \nanother region or city, enter 0 + 2-digit carrier code (between 10 and 21) + single-digit area code, \nfollowed by the seven-digit number. \nCellular phones\nCellular to cellular calls within the same city are simple \u2013 just dial the eight-digit number. \nA recorded message (in Spanish) may prompt you for a carrier number, indicating that the person is either not within the same city or region (or has a SIM card from another region), in which case you must then redial using a 0 + 2-digit carrier number plus the eight-digit cellular number. \nFor cellular to landline calls within the same city, in most cases, you must dial the single-digit \narea code, and then the seven-digit number. \nFor cellular to landline calls to another reg ion, in most cases, you must dial a 0 + 2-digit \ncarrier code, followed by the single-digit area code, and then the seven-digit number, eg if dialing Sucre from La Paz, dial 0 + 10 (or any one of the carrier codes \u2013 10 is Entel\u2019s network carrier) + 4 (Sucre\u2019s area code) + the seven-digit number. \nInternational calls \nFor international calls, you must first dial 00 followed by a country code, area code (without the first 0) and the telephone number. \n19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   338 19-bolivia-directory-bol7.indd   338 8/12/09   09:30:23 8/12/09   09:30:23", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3678, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f529df1-6a3c-4acc-bbf9-9e17474339a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f529df1-6a3c-4acc-bbf9-9e17474339a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "339", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "340977d9-f621-4c5e-980a-056f949ca6e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "339", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "c8d817a981fb7b8098701bb194e24e77725fb50a41d234d6d00ea42636cdff0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76eea4ec-0b21-4b83-95e6-5bc5ec59026f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fdfc7191f7c929b4a3b24ed7f1f08ff35e5f7a48918e17272a326df2158a8b1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DIRECTORYlonelyplanet.com DIRECTORY  \u2022\u2022  Time   339\nequal to the average Bolivian monthly \nwage.

Most real development and promotion has been courtesy of the private sector, which is the chief source of brochures and promotional programs.\nThere are offices covering the prefectura  \n(department) and alcald\u00eda  (local munici-\npality) of a particular city. The major cities, such as Santa Cruz and La Paz, have of-fices for both, although the different tour-ism bodies range from helpful to useless. Most municipal offices can provide street plans and answer specific questions about local transportation and attractions. The most worthwhile are those in La Paz, Santa Cruz and Oruro, while those in other major cities seem to be considerably less useful. Note that the posted opening hours are not always followed. There are no tourist of-fices abroad. Servicio Nacional de \u00c1reas Protegidas (SERNAP) is the best source of information about Bolivia\u2019s national parks.

You will, however, see locals overcoming myriad obstacles and challenges while mak-ing their daily rounds. If you encounter difficulties yourself, you\u2019ll likely find locals willing to go out of their way to lend a hand. For general information, visit the Global \nAccess \u2013 Disabled Travel Network  \n(www.global\naccessnews.com) .\nVISAS\nPassports must be valid for six months \nbeyond the date of entry. Entry or exit stamps are free, and attempts at charging should be met with polite refusal; ask for a receipt if the issue is pressed. Personal Calls from telephone offices are getting cheaper all the time, especially now that there\u2019s competition between the carriers \n\u2013 \nthey can vary between B$1.50 and B$8 per minute. \nIn La Paz the cheapest of cheap calls can \nbe made from international calling centers around Calle Sag\u00e1rnaga for around B$2 per minute. \nSome Entel offices accept reverse-charge \n(collect) calls; others will give you the office\u2019s number and let you be called back. For reverse-charge calls  from a private line, \nring an international operator: for the USA \n(AT&T toll-free % 800-10-1110; MCI % 800-10-2222) , \nCanada  (Teleglobe % 800-10-0101) or UK (BT % 800-\n10-0044) \u2013 be aware that these calls can be \nbank-breakers.\nINTERNET CALLS\nMuch cheaper Net2Phone internet call cent-ers, charging as little as B$0.20 a minute to a fixed line in the USA or Spain, exist in major cities, but connections can be shaky. Most internet places have Skype installed, which you can use at no extra cost, just paying for the time online.\nTIME\nBolivian time is four hours behind Green-wich Mean Time (GMT), and an hour ahead of the US Eastern Standard Time. When it\u2019s noon in La Paz, it\u2019s 4pm in London, 11am in New York, 8am in San Francisco, 4am the following day in Auckland and 2am the following day in Sydney.\nTOILETS\nToilet humor becomes the norm in Bolivia.

Many neigh-boring countries, including Brazil, require anyone entering from Bolivia to have proof of a yellow-fever vaccination. If necessary, a jab can often be administered at the border but it is preferable to take care of this at home. For more on yellow fever, see p356.\nWOMEN TRAVELERS\nWomen\u2019s rights in Bolivia are nearing modern standards and cities are more liberal than country regions. But despite the importance of women in Bolivian society and the elevation of females in public life (including a female president and women mayors), the machismo mind-set still per vades in Bolivia. As a female traveling alone, the mere fact that you appear to be unmarried and far from your home and family may cause you to appear suspiciously disreputable. \nBear in mind that modesty is expected of \nwomen in much of Spanish-speaking Latin America. Local women who wear Western dress in the warmer and lower areas tend to show more flesh than elsewhere in the country. That said, as a foreigner, avoid testing the system alone in a bar in a mini-skirt. Conservative dress and confidence without arrogance are a must for gringas, more to be respectful than anything else. Men are generally more forward and flir-tatious in the lowlands, where the latino culture is more prevalent, than in the Altiplano where indigenous cultures prevail. The best advice is to watch the standards of well-dressed Bolivian women in any particular area and follow their example. \nAs a safety measure for a woman traveler, \ntry to avoid arriving at a place at night. If you need to take a taxi at night, it\u2019s prefer-able to call for a radio taxi than to flag one down in the street. Note that during the period leading up to Carnaval and during the festivities, a woman traveling solo can be a popular target for water bombs, which can feel like quite a harassment or at least an annoyance.\nSee also Solo Travelers on p337.documents \u2013 passports and visas \u2013 must be carried at all times, especially in lowland regions. It\u2019s safest to carry photocopies rather than originals.\nBolivian visa requirements can be arbitrarily \nchanged and interpreted. Regulations, in-cluding entry stays, are likely to change. Each Bolivian consulate and border crossing may have its own entry procedures and idiosyncrasies.\nIn 2007, as an act of reciprocity, the \nMorales government introduced visas for US citizens visiting Bolivia (a 90-day visa valid for five years costs US$135). At the time of writing, it was possible to obtain the visa upon arrival in Bolivia; check with the Bolivian embassy  \n(% 202-483-4410, 202-328-3712; \nwww.bolivia-usa.org, in Spanish; 3014 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC) \nbefore traveling. \nCitizens of most South American and \nWestern European countries can get a tourist card on entry for stays up to 90 days (depending on the nationality). Citizens of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan are granted 30 days, while citizens of Israel are granted 90 days. This is subject to change; always check with your consulate prior to entry. If you want to stay longer, you have to extend your tourist card (easily accomplished at the immigration office in any major city with a letter requesting the extension; it\u2019s free for some nationalities \u2013 for others, it costs B$198 per 30-day extension). The maximum time travelers are permitted to stay in the country is 180 days in one year. Alternatively, you can apply for a visa. Visas are issued by Bolivian consular representatives, including those in neighbor-ing South American countries.

Transporte \nA\u00e9reo Boliviano \n(% 2-268-1111; www.tam.bo) , better \nknown as TAM, offers flights to and from smaller towns within Bolivia, although it is known for its cancelations and delays. Amaszonas  \n(% 2-222-0848; www.amaszonas.com)  \nflies small planes from La Paz to Rurre-nabaque, Trinidad, Santa Cruz and other lowland destinations. The small airline AeroCon  \n(www.aerocon.bo)  connects the country\u2019s \nmajor cities as well as some more remote corners. BOA \n(www.boa.bo) , a new airline, was \nstarting to fly between major cities at the time of research; however, it was unfortunately not particularly reliable yet.GETTING THERE & \nAWAY\nA landlocked country, Bolivia has numerous \nentry/exit points. Some are easier and more accessible than others; the more remote borders are recommended for intrepid travelers only \u2013 those with time and lust for unpredictable adventure.\nFlights, tours and rail tickets can be booked \nonline at www.lonelyplanet.com/bookings.\nENTERING THE COUNTRY\nIf you have your documents in order and you are willing to answer a few questions about the aim of your visit, entry into Bolivia should be a breeze. If crossing at a smaller border post, you might well be asked to pay an \u2018exit fee.\u2019 Unless otherwise noted in the text, these fees are strictly unofficial. Note that Bolivian border times can be unreliable at best; always check with a migraci\u00f3n  office \nin the nearest major town. Also, if you plan to cross the border outside the stated hours, or at a point where there is no border post, you can usually do so by obtaining an exit/entry stamp from the nearest migraci\u00f3n  of-\nfice on departure/arrival.TRANSPORTATION\nDEP ARTURE TAX\nThe international departure tax, payable in \ncash only at the airport, is US$25 (US$31 if you stayed in Bolivia for more than three months). Be aware that there\u2019s also a 15% tax on international airfares purchased in Bolivia. \n20-transport-in-bolivia-bol7.indd   342 20-transport-in-bolivia-bol7.indd   342 8/12/09   09:29:05 8/12/09   09:29:05", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3262, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "718fe8f2-6128-41a5-9fdf-76a4929fdfd3": {"__data__": {"id_": "718fe8f2-6128-41a5-9fdf-76a4929fdfd3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "596c595d-3b1b-4d3b-9f46-33b6e4ec6223", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "127a06e8c3e8deb40562dcac9bf06e80ebb3dee96b98e28a5dba64bae0db3b35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "TRANSPORTATIONlonelyplanet.com GETTING THERE & AWAY  \u2022\u2022  Air   343\nINTERCONTINENTAL (RTW) TICKETS\nRound-the-world (RTW) tickets can be real \nbargains if you are coming to South America from the other side of the world. They are generally put together by the airline alliances, and give you a limited period (usually a year) in which to circumnavigate the globe.\nAn alternative type of RTW ticket is one \nput together by a travel agent. These tickets are more expensive than airline RTW fares, but you choose your itinerary. Travel agents, by combining tickets from two low-cost airlines, can also offer multiple desti-nation fares that are cheaper than a RTW ticket, and allow for two stops on the way to and from South America. AIRLINES FLYING TO/FROM BOLIVIA\nAirlines with international flights and offices in La Paz include the following:Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas\n (airline code AR; % 3-333-\n9776; www.aerolineas.com.ar)\nAeroSur  (airline code 5L; % 3-336-7400; www.aerosur\n.com)\nAmerican Airlines  (airline code AA; % 2-334-1314; \nwww.aa.com)\nGrupo Taca  (airline code TA; % 800-10-TACA; www.taca.com)\nLan Airlines (airline code LA; % 800-100-521; \nwww.lan.com)\nTAM Mercosur  (airline code PZ; % 2-244-3442; www\n.tam.com.br)\nVarig-Gol Airlines  (airline code G3; % 800-100-121; \nwww.voegol.com.br) \nTickets\nThe world aviation market has never been so \ncompetitive, making air travel better value than ever. Research your options carefully to get yourself the best possible deal. Online ticket sales work well if you are doing a simple one-way or return trip on specified dates. However, the whiz-bang online fare generators are in no way a substitute for a knowledgeable travel agent. Please note that ticket prices in this chapter do not include any taxes or fuel levies, which are liable to significantly increase air travel costs.THINGS CHANGE\u2026\nThe information in this chapter is particu-\nlarly vulnerable to change. Check directly with the airline or a travel agent to make sure you understand how a fare (and ticket you may buy) works and be aware of the security requirements for international travel. Shop carefully. The details given in this chapter should be regarded as point-ers and are not a substitute for your own careful, up-to-date research.CLIMATE CHANGE & TRAVEL \nClimate change is a serious threat to the ecosystems that humans rely upon, and air travel is the fastest-growing contributor to the problem. Lonely Planet regards travel, overall, as a global benefit, but believes we all have a responsibility to limit our personal impact on global warming.\nFlying & Climate Change\nPretty much every form of motor travel generates CO2 (the main cause of human-induced climate \nchange) but planes are far and away the worst offenders, not just because of the sheer distances they allow us to travel, but because they release greenhouse gases high into the atmosphere. The statistics are frightening: two people taking a return flight between Europe and the US will contribute as much to climate change as does an average household\u2019s entire gas and electricity consumption over a whole year.  \nCarbon Offset Schemes\nClimatecare.org and other websites use \u2018carbon calculators\u2019 that allow jetsetters to offset the greenhouse gases they are responsible for with contributions to energy-saving projects and other climate-friendly initiatives in the developing world \u2013 including projects in India, Honduras, Kazakhstan and Uganda. \nLonely Planet, together with Rough Guides and other concerned partners in the travel industry, \nsupports the carbon offset scheme run by climatecare.org. Lonely Planet offsets all of its staff and author travel.\nFor more information check out our website: lonelyplanet.com.\n20-transport-in-bolivia-bol7.indd   343 20-transport-in-bolivia-bol7.indd   343 8/12/09   09:29:05 8/12/09   09:29:05", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad5f69e0-f57d-44a7-9ae7-fe1dfd9e1483": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad5f69e0-f57d-44a7-9ae7-fe1dfd9e1483", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "344", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a3adf94-35ac-439b-82a5-d22190e121c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "344", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "5884930804879e8a8c3ff0a5693a88cdc175fbc002f57a1165dbbad8bb5851b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ba816c3-edc3-4061-aa42-91f9d80554d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8181a7e36d46b6440dbd56e11f59fee98dde7353b1f481afc5918622caed8d0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "TRANSPORTATIONlonelyplanet.com 344    GETTING THERE & AWAY  \u2022\u2022  Air\nAustralians, New Zealanders and most \nWestern Europeans, unless they\u2019re traveling on a nonaccredited airline (which includes most Latin American airlines).\nSouth America\nAeroSur connects La Paz to Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Cuzco and Lima several times a week.

Similar buses go direct to Cuzco. A cheaper way from Copacabana is via minibus from Plaza Sucre to the Kasani-Yunguyo border (B$3, 15 minutes); there\u2019s onward transportation to the border at Yunguyo (five minutes), and on to Puno. \nCrillon Tours  \n(% 2-233-7533; www.titicaca.com; \nCamacho 1223, La Paz)  sells tickets for all-inclusive \nbus/hydrofoil tours between La Paz and Puno.\nGETTING AROUND\nBolivia boasts an extensive transportation system that covers most parts of the country in varying degrees of comfort and ease. Locals are creative in the ways they get from one place to another, taking a variety of movilidades  (anything that moves!) includ-\ning buses, trucks and boats. Interruptions to travel plans are usually not caused by lack of transportation, but by protests in the form of road blockades, floods, damaged roads (especially in the lowlands during rainy season) and, in the Amazon, low river levels. In the major tourist destinations, regular bus transportation usually ensures efficient travel.\nAIR\nAir travel in Bolivia is inexpensive and it\u2019s the quickest and most reliable means of reaching out-of-the-way places. It\u2019s also the only means of transportation that isn\u2019t washed out during the wet season. Although weather-related disruptions definitely occur, planes eventually get through even during summer flooding in northern Bolivia.\nAirlines in Bolivia\nBolivia\u2019s major ariline, AeroSur  (www.aerosur\n.com) , as well as smaller airlines such \nas Amaszonas  (www.amaszonas.com)  and AeroCon  \n(www.aerocon.bo) , connect the country\u2019s major \ncities and remote corners. They all charge similar fares and allow 15kg of luggage, ecluding 3kg of carry-on luggage. \nThe military airline, Transportes A\u00e9reos \nMilitares  \n(TAM; Map pp68-9; % 2-268-1101, 277-5222; \nwww.tam.bo; Montes 738) , operates domestic \nflights in smaller planes that fly closer to the buses (note the latter cannot be done in the reverse order). Note there\u2019s a one-hour trip between the Bolivian border and San Pedro, for which it\u2019s better to arrange transporta-tion in advance, in case taxis aren\u2019t waiting. For more, see p177. Alternatively, there is a lesser used road route between Oruro and Iquique with a border at Pisiga/Colchane  \n(h 8am-8pm) ; p161 for bus details. \nA crossing can be done via train or \nroad from Uyuni to Calama (p172), whose border crossing is Ollag\u00fce-Avaroa  \n(h 8am-\n8pm). \nParaguay\nThe easiest route between Paraguay and \nBolivia is to cross from Pedro Juan Caballero (in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay) to Ponta Por\u00e3 (Brazil), and then travel by bus or train to Corumb\u00e1 (Brazil) and Quijarro (Bolivia).\nThe three-day overland Trans-Chaco bus \ntrip (see boxed text, p258) between Santa Cruz, Bolivia and Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, now has a daily bus service during the dry season, but it\u2019s still not a breeze. Note that Bolivian customs formalities take place at Ibibobo, where your passport will be checked, about an hour before the Paraguayan check-point of Infante Rivarola; the immigration and customs are down the road at Mariscal Estigarribia. This is a notorious smuggling route so expect to be lined up with your bags as customs officials and sniffer dogs rifle through your possessions.\nFor the adventurous, river transportation \nbetween Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, and Bolivia (via Corumb\u00e1, Brazil) is likely to involve a series of short journeys and informal arrangements with individual boat captains.

To \nvisit Isla del Sol, you can take a tour, hire a launch or catch a scheduled service in Copacabana, or look for a lift in Y ampupata or the villages en route. Cruises by motor-boat or hydrofoil are provided by a couple of well-established tour companies; see boxed text, p99.\nRiver Boat\nThere\u2019s no scheduled passenger service on the Amazon, so travelers almost invariably wind up on some sort of cargo vessel. The most popular routes are from Puerto Villarroel to Trinidad (p300) and Trinidad to Guayaramer\u00edn (p315). There are also much less frequented routes from Rurrenabaque or Puerto Heath to Riberalta (p325). \nBUS\nBuses and their various iterations are the most popular form of Bolivian transporta-tion. It\u2019s cheap and relatively safe but also quite uncomfortable or nerve-wracking at times. Long-distance bus lines in Bolivia are called flotas,  large buses are known as \nbuses,  three-quarter (usually older) ones are \ncalled micros  and minibuses are just that. If \nlooking for a bus terminal, ask for la termi-\nnal terrestre  or la terminal de buses . Each \nterminal charges a small fee of a couple of bolivianos, which you pay to an agent upon boarding or when purchasing the ticket at the counter.\nIt\u2019s a lot safer to travel (and the views are \nbetter) during the day. Drunken driving is illegal, but bus drivers have been known to sip the hard stuff on long nighttime hauls. There have been numerous reports of items disappearing from buses\u2019 internal overhead compartments. Hold on tight to your day packs and bags if they are with you in the bus. Backpacks and bags are generally safe when stored in the baggage compartment but try to watch as your luggage is loaded \u2013 there have been instances of \u2018lost\u2019 or \u2018disap-peared\u2019 bags. You will be given a baggage tag, which you must show when reclaiming your bag.\nExcept on the most popular runs, most \ncompanies\u2019 buses inexplicably depart at roughly the same time, regardless of the number of competitors. Between any two cities, you should have no trouble finding at least one daily bus. On the most popular landscape. Prices are as much as 20% lower than other airlines and reservations can be made in every town with a travel agency that has an online booking system; note that schedules can change without notice. They are strict with the 15kg baggage limit; each additional kilo costs around B$3.50, depending on the length of the flight. \nDeparture Tax\nAASANA (Administraci\u00f3n de Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares a la Navegaci\u00f3n A\u00e9rea), the government agency responsible for air-ports and air traffic, charges a B$11 to B$16 domestic departure tax, which is payable at its desk after check-in. International depar-ture tax is US$25. Some airports also levy a municipal tax of up to B$7. \nBICYCLE\nFor cyclists who can cope with the challenges of cold winds, poor road conditions, high altitude and steep terrain, Bolivia is a para-dise. Traffic isn\u2019t a serious problem, but intimidating buses and camiones  (flatbed \ntrucks) may leave cyclists lost in clouds of dust or embedded in mud. However, finding supplies may prove difficult, so cyclists in remote areas must carry ample food and water. Given these challenges, many prefer to leave the work to a tour company. \nBolivia has its fair share of inexpensive \nbikes \u2013 mostly supermarket beaters from China. However, quality new wheels are few and far between. Your best bet for purchas-ing a used, touring-worthy stead is through agencies in La Paz.

Bear in mind that spare parts are a rare commodity outside cities. A high-clearance 4WD vehicle is essential for off-road travel. You\u2019ll need tools, spare tires, a puncture repair kit, extra gas and fluids, and as many spare parts as possible. For emergencies, carry camping equipment and plenty of rations. You\u2019ll also need a good travel insurance policy purchased back home. If you do decide to get insurance in Bolivia, this broker is the best go-to point for information about various insurance companies and what they offer: Consultores \nde Seguros  \n(% 800-102-266; www.consegsa.com). \nLow-grade (85-octane) gasoline and \ndiesel fuel are available at surtidores in all \ncities and major towns. Gas costs around B$3.74 per liter, more in remote areas. \nIn lowland areas, where temperatures are \nhot and roads are scarce, motorbikes are popular for zipping around the plazas, as well as exploring areas not served by pub-lic transportation. They can be rented for around B$80 to B$100 per day from moto-taxi stands. Gringo-run agencies offering motorcycle tours through the rugged high-land are popping up like mushrooms in the larger cities. Bear in mind that many travel insurance policies will not cover you for injuries arising from motorbike accidents. \nFor details on bringing your own vehicle \ninto Bolivia, see p345.\nDriver\u2019s License\nMost Bolivian car-rental agencies will accept your home driver\u2019s license, but if you\u2019re doing a lot of driving, it\u2019s wise to back it up with an International Driver\u2019s License. Bolivia doesn\u2019t require special motorcycle licenses, but neighboring countries do. For motorcycle and moped rentals, all that is normally required is a passport.\nPrivate Drivers\nHiring a driver can be a more comfortable and efficient alternative to being squashed in a bus on bad roads for long periods. Alternatively, many people just want trans-routes you can choose between dozens of daily departures.\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to check the vehicles \nof several companies before purchasing your ticket \u2013 some buses are ramshackle affairs with broken windows, cracked windshields, and worn tires; it\u2019s better to stay away from these and look for a better vehicle, even if it means paying a little more. Don\u2019t save on safety.\nWhen traveling in the highlands, especially \nat night, make sure you have a sleeping bag or a blanket handy. There\u2019s often no heat-ing and the temperatures are freezing. On longer bus journeys, make sure you have plenty of water and snacks, as these may not be available en route.\nAvoid sitting at the back of the bus \u2013 \nyou\u2019ll feel the bumpy roads more severely and your bladder won\u2019t be happy.\nDon\u2019t count on arriving at your destination \nat a said time; journey times are completely unpredictable in Bolivia, especially during the rainy season. \nClasses & Costs\nThe only choices you\u2019ll have to make are on major, long-haul routes, where the better com panies offer coche (or \u2018bus\u2019 ) cama  \n(sleeper) service for around double the com\u00fan  or normal going rate. The VCR on \nthe newest buses will be in better shape than the reclining seats, heaters may  func-\ntion and toilets (yes, toilets) may  work.  \nPrices vary according to the different \nstandards of buses (from the more luxurious bus cama  service to the ancient Bluebird-style \nbuses) and the length of trip (whether over-night or short day-hop). An overnight trip from La Paz to Cochabamba costs between B$45 and B$90 and from La Paz to Potos\u00ed between B$52 and B$80. \nReservations\nTo be safe, reserve bus tickets at least several hours in advance.

For the least expensive 4WD, companies charge around US$65 per day plus US$0.37 per kilometer. Weekly rates (with up to 1000km free) start at around US$350 for a compact and US$470 for the cheapest 4WD.\nFor listings of better-known agencies, see \nGetting Around in the major cities.\nRoad Rules\nTraffic regulations aren\u2019t that different from those in North America or Europe. Speed limits are infrequently posted, but in most cases the state of the road will prevent you from exceeding them anyway. \nBolivians keep to the right. When two cars \napproach an uncontrolled intersection from different directions, the driver who honks (or gets there first) tends to have right of way if passing straight through \u2013 but be aware, this can be a bit hit and miss. In La Paz, those going up the hill have right of way at an intersection. When two vehicles meet on a narrow mountain road, the downhill vehicle must reverse until there\u2019s room for the other to pass.\nHITCHHIKING\nThanks to relatively easy access to camiones  \nand a profusion of buses, hitchhiking isn\u2019t really necessary or popular in Bolivia. Still, it\u2019s not unknown and drivers of movilidades  \n\u2013 coches  (cars), camionetas  (pickup trucks), \nNGO vehicles, gas trucks and other vehicles \u2013 are usually happy to pick up passengers when they have room. Always ask the price, if any, before climbing aboard, even for short distances; if they do charge, it should amount to about half the bus fare for the equivalent distance.\nPlease note that hitchhiking is never en-\ntirely safe in any country. If you decide to hitchhike, you should understand that you are taking a small but potentially serious risk.

Camiones generally cost around 50% \nof the bus fare. You\u2019ll need time and a strong constitution; travel can be excruciatingly slow and rough, depending on the cargo and number of passengers. A major plus is the raw experience, including the best views of the countryside.\nOn any cami\u00f3n  trip, especially in the \nhighlands, day or night, be sure to take plenty of warm clothing as night tempera-tures can plunge below freezing; at best they can be chilly.\nMicros, Minibuses & Trufis\nMicros (half-size buses) are used in larger cities and serve as Bolivia\u2019s least expensive form of public transportation. They follow set routes, and the route numbers or letters are usually marked on a placard behind the windshield. This is often backed by a de-scription of the route, including the streets that are followed to reach the end of the line. They can be hailed anywhere along their routes. When you want to disembark, move toward the front and tell the driver or assistant where you want them to stop.\nMinibuses and trufis (which may be \ncars, vans or minibuses), also known as colectivos, are prevalent in the larger towns and cities, and follow set routes that are numbered and described on placards. They are always cheaper than taxis and nearly as convenient. As with micros, you can board \nor alight anywhere along their route.\nTaxis\nUrban taxis are relatively inexpensive. Few are equipped with meters but in most cities and towns there are standard per-person fares for short hauls. In some places taxis are collective and behave more like trufis,  \ncharging a set rate per person. However, if you have three or four people all headed for the same place, you may be able to negotiate a reduced rate for the entire group.\nRadio taxis, on the other hand, always \ncharge a set rate for up to four people; if you squeeze in five people, the fare increases by a small margin.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4156, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad8982d8-e3de-4f85-8082-c2f1588673b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad8982d8-e3de-4f85-8082-c2f1588673b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "350", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf87f71-67a9-4d99-8279-6123c5507f2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "350", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "b32601bb098b64eaeed1643fb7bd52b7df3c2d445bbe14acfc090bbc10a3f3d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64915ac2-e403-4b8a-b136-949b9243552a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "350", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "c38813750f52147674bfe4997e07e63995e9fecd4b73586f1368886620880d90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Minibuses and trufis (which may be \ncars, vans or minibuses), also known as colectivos, are prevalent in the larger towns and cities, and follow set routes that are numbered and described on placards.

Travelers who receive the recommended vaccinations (see box, opposite) and follow a few basic common-sense precautions usually come away with nothing more unpleasant than a little diarrhea.\nBEFORE YOU GO\nSince most vaccines don\u2019t produce immunity until at least two weeks after they\u2019re given, visit a physician four to eight weeks before departure. Ask your doctor for an Interna-tional Certificate of Vaccination, containing a list of your vaccinations. This is mandatory for countries such as Bolivia, Brazil and Vene-zuela, which may require proof of yellow fever vaccination on entry, but it\u2019s a good idea to carry it wherever you travel. \nBring medications in their original \ncontainers, clearly labeled, and a signed, dated letter from your physician describing all medical conditions. If carrying syringes or needles, have a physician\u2019s letter stating their medical necessity. H1N1 \nThe H1N1 virus (commonly referred to as \u2018swine flu\u2019) was given a \u2018Phase 6\u2019 rat-ing by the World Health Organization in June 2009. This means that the virus is now considered to be a global pandemic. Like most countries, Bolivia has been affected. As of October 2009, the virus was widespread geographically in Bolivia but the number of cases was relatively low, as was the severity of these cases. \nAt press time, airport staff in some coun-\ntries were screening arriving passengers for symptoms of H1N1 flu. Check with the em-bassy of the country you\u2019re visiting to see if they have imposed any travel restrictions. It\u2019s best not to travel if you have flu-like symptoms of any sort. \nFor the latest information, check with the \nWorld Health Organization  (\nwww.who.int ). \nINSURANCE\nIf your health insurance does not cover you \nfor medical expenses abroad, consider sup-plemental insurance. Check the Bookings & Services section of the website of Lonely \nPlanet \n(www.lonelyplanet.com/travel_services)  for \nmore information. Find out in advance if your insurance plan will make payments directly to providers or reimburse you later for overseas health expenditures. Most private-practice providers in Bolivia expect cash payment and should provide receipts for your insurance company claims and reimbursement. Credit cards are usually not accepted for medical services.\nMEDICAL CHECKLIST\n\u0084 antibiotics\n\u0084 antidiarrheal drugs (eg loperamide)\n\u0084 acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin \n\u0084 anti-inflammatory drugs (eg ibuprofen) \n\u0084 antihistamines (for hay fever and allergic \nreactions)\n\u0084 antibacterial ointment (eg Bactroban) for \ncuts and abrasions \n\u0084 steroid cream or cortisone (for poison \nivy and other allergic rashes)\n\u0084 bandages, gauze, gauze rolls\n\u0084 adhesive or paper tape\n\u0084 scissors, safety pins, tweezersHealth\nBefore You Go 352\nH1N1 352Insurance 352Medical Checklist 352Online Resources 353Further Reading 353In Transit 353Deep Vein Thrombosis 353Jet Lag & Motion Sickness 354In Bolivia 354Availability & Cost of Healthcare 354Infectious Diseases 354Travelers\u2019 Diarrhea 358Environmental Hazards 358Traveling with Children 359Women\u2019s Health 360\n21-health-bol7.indd   Sec1:352 21-health-bol7.indd   Sec1:352 8/12/09   09:34:28 8/12/09   09:34:28", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3247, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d425faf-4b02-463c-8312-500fba85fec7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d425faf-4b02-463c-8312-500fba85fec7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "353", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "56adcf0a-0e61-435d-bce7-e92cdd8d83e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "353", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "fb1ad195812d5ceac3bf12865db2c41921683b86af9d0e05b26708cff19e8b45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HEALTHlonelyplanet.com\nConsult your government\u2019s travel health \nwebsite before departure: Australia\n (www.smartraveller.gov.au/tips/travelwell\n.html)\nCanada  (www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/index.html)\nUK (www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/index\n.htm)\nUS (www.cdc.gov/travel)\nFURTHER READING\nFor further information see Healthy Travel \nCentral & South America, also from Lonely \nPlanet.

For a list of reputable medi-\ncal and dental contacts in La Paz, see also p65.\nIf you are unlucky enough to develop \na life-threatening medical problem, you\u2019ll probably want to be evacuated to a coun-try that is able to provide state-of-the-art medical care. Since this may cost tens of thousands of dollars, be sure you have insurance to cover this before you depart.\nBolivian pharmacies offer most of the \nmedications available in other countries. In general it\u2019s safer to buy pharmaceuticals made by international manufacturers rather than local companies; buy the brand name prescribed by your doctor, not the generic brand drugs that may be offered at lower prices. These medications may be out of date or have no quality control from the man-ufacturer. For a list of pharmacies, see the US Embassy website (http://bolivia.usembassy.gov/uploads/images/eOd9_kCdEz0Za_pollKATw/PHYSICIANSLIST1.pdf).\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\nCholera \nCholera is an intestinal infection acquired through ingestion of contaminated food or water. The main symptom is profuse, watery diarrhea, which may be so severe that it causes life-threatening dehydration. The key treatment is drinking oral rehydration solution. Antibiotics are also given, usually tetracycline or doxycycline, though quino-lone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are also effective. \nCholera sometimes occurs in Bolivia, but \nit\u2019s rare among travelers. A cholera vaccine is no longer required. There are effective vaccines, but they\u2019re not available in many countries and are only recommended for those at particularly high risk.\nDengue Fever\nDengue fever is a viral infection found throughout South America. Dengue is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which bite preferentially during the daytime and are usually found close to human habita-tions, often indoors. They breed in artificial water containers, such as jars, barrels, cans, cisterns, metal drums, plastic containers and discarded tires. As a result, dengue is especially common in densely populated, urban environments. blood clots are reabsorbed uneventfully, some may break off and travel through the blood vessels to the lungs, where they could cause life-threatening complications. \nThe chief symptom of deep vein throm-\nbosis is swelling or pain of the foot, ankle or calf, usually but not always on just one side. When a blood clot travels to the lungs, it may cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. Travelers with any of these symptoms should immediately seek medical attention.\nTo prevent deep vein thrombosis on \nlong flights, walk about the cabin, perform isometric compressions of the leg muscles (ie contract the leg muscles while sitting), drink plenty of fluids, and avoid alcohol. \nJET LAG & MOTION SICKNESS\nJet lag is common when crossing more than five time zones, leading to insomnia, fatigue, malaise or nausea. To avoid jet lag try drink-ing plenty of fluids (nonalcoholic) and eat-ing light meals. On arrival get exposure to natural sunlight and readjust your schedule (for meals, sleep, etc) as soon as possible. \nAntihistamines such as dimenhydrinate \n(Dramamine) and meclizine (Antivert, Bonine) are usually the first choice for treating motion sickness. Their main side effect is drowsiness. A herbal alternative is ginger. \nIN BOLIVIA\nAVAILABILITY & COST OF \nHEALTHCARE \nGood medical care is available in the larger \ncities, but may be difficult to find in rural areas.

Addi-tionally, the vaccine is recommended for anyone who anticipates sexual contact with the local inhabitants or a possible need for \nmedical, dental or other treatments while abroad, especially if a need for transfusions or injections is expected. \nThe hepatitis B vaccine is safe and highly \neffective. However, a total of three injec-tions are necessary to establish full immu-nity. Several countries added the hepatitis B vaccine to the list of routine childhood im-munizations in the 1980s, so many young adults are already protected.\nMalaria\nMalaria occurs in every South American country except Chile, Uruguay and the Falkland Islands. It\u2019s transmitted by mos-quito bites, usually between dusk and dawn. The main symptom is high spiking fevers, which may be accompanied by chills, sweats, headache, body aches, weakness, vomiting or diarrhea. Severe cases may involve the central nervous system and lead to seizures, confusion, coma and death.\nTaking malaria pills is strongly recom-\nmended for areas below 2500m (8202ft) in the departments of Beni, Santa Cruz and Pando, where the risk is highest. Falci-parum malaria, which is the most dan-gerous kind, occurs in Beni and Pando. Malaria is not present in the cities of these departments currently. \nThere is a choice of three malaria pills, \nall of which work about equally well. Mefloquine (Lariam) is taken once weekly in a dosage of 250mg, starting one to two weeks before arrival, and continuing through the trip and for four weeks after return. The problem is that a certain percentage of people (the number is controversial) develop neuropsychiatric side effects, which may range from mild to severe. Stomachache and diarrhea are also common. Atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone) is taken once daily with food, starting two days before arrival and continuing daily until seven days after departure. Side effects are typically mild. Doxycycline is relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain, but it is taken daily and can cause an exaggerated sunburn reaction.Dengue causes flu-like symptoms, in-\ncluding fever, muscle aches, joint pains, headaches, nausea and vomiting, often followed by a rash. The body aches may be quite uncomfortable, but most cases resolve uneventfully in a few days. Severe cases usually occur in children under age 15 who are experiencing their second dengue infection.\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment for \ndengue fever except to take analgesics such as acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol) and drink plenty of fluids. Severe cases of the disease may require hospitalization for administration of intravenous fluids and supportive care. There is no vaccine. The cornerstone of prevention is to take ade-quate insect protection measures (p359). \nIn winter 2009, there was a major out-\nbreak of dengue fever that turned into a countrywide health emergency. This usu-ally happens during the rainy season in the areas below 2800m, so make sure you read the travel advisories.\nHepatitis A\nHepatitis A is the second most common travel-related infection (after travelers\u2019 di-arrhea). It\u2019s a viral infection of the liver that is usually acquired by ingestion of contami-nated water, food or ice, or by direct contact with infected persons. The illness occurs throughout the world, but the incidence is higher in developing nations. Symptoms may include fever, malaise, jaundice, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Most cases resolve without complications, though hepatitis A occasionally causes severe liver damage. There is no treatment.\nThe vaccine for hepatitis A is extremely \nsafe and effective. A booster six to 12 months later lasts for at least 10 years. It is encour-aged for Bolivia. A vaccine has not been established for pregnant women or children under two years \u2013 instead, they should be given a gammaglobulin injection.\nHepatitis B\nLike hepatitis A, hepatitis B is a liver in-fection that occurs worldwide but is more common in developing nations.

Rabies occurs in all South American countries. In Bolivia most cases are related to dog bites. Risk is greatest in the southeastern part of the country.\nThe rabies vaccine is safe, but a full series \nrequires three injections and is quite ex-pensive. Those at high risk for rabies, such as animal handlers and spelunkers (cave explorers), should certainly get the vaccine. In addition, those at lower risk for animal bites should consider asking for the vaccine if they might be traveling to remote areas and might not have access to appropriate medical care if needed. The treatment for a possibly rabid bite consists of the rabies vaccine with rabies-immune globulin. It\u2019s effective, but must be given promptly. Most travelers don\u2019t need the rabies vaccine.\nAll animal bites and scratches must be \npromptly and thoroughly cleansed with large amounts of soap and water; contact health authorities to determine whether further treatment is necessary (p359).\nTyphoid Fever\nTyphoid fever is caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated by a species of salmonella known as salmonella typhi. Fever occurs in virtually all cases. Other symptoms may include headache, malaise, muscle aches, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain. Either diarrhea or constipation may occur. Possible com-plications include intestinal perforation, intestinal bleeding, confusion, delirium or (rarely) coma.\nA typhoid vaccine is a good idea.

One option is to take four tablets of Malarone once daily for three days. However, Malarone should not be used for treatment if you\u2019re already taking it for prevention. An alternative is to take 650mg quinine three times daily and 100mg doxycycline twice daily for one week. If you start self-medication, see a doctor at the earliest possible opportunity.\nIf you develop a fever after returning \nhome, see a physician, as malaria symptoms may not occur for months.\nPlague\nSmall outbreaks of the plague sometimes occur in Bolivia, most recently in the town of San Pedro (in the department of La Paz) in the mid-1990s. The plague is usually transmitted to humans by the bite of rodent fleas, typically when rodents die off. Symp-toms include fever, chills, muscle aches and malaise, associated with the development of an acutely swollen, exquisitely painful lymph node, known as a bubo, most often in the groin. Most travelers are at extremely low risk for this disease. However, if you might have contact with rodents or their fleas, you should bring along a bottle of doxycycline, to be taken prophylactically during periods of exposure. Those less than eight years old or allergic to doxycycline should take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole instead. In addition, you should avoid areas containing rodent burrows or nests, never handle sick or dead animals, and follow the guidelines in this chapter for protecting yourself from insect bites (p359).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4214, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3f0247f-b67b-494c-9271-025c480f6454": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3f0247f-b67b-494c-9271-025c480f6454", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "356", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47c47097-72fa-4a61-8ea4-2e9ab4ceed45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "356", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "8e095240c3b9f0eb22ff43c578cfb6c503b629fe283708eeb4c26f1d519ddfa7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1e349f8-a8c9-428b-a54c-a36db9e02f68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "356", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "38c3c1fc0fa5588b341e49325fcfbd2b522d23cfab4c59371b304cbc15a892c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The plague is usually transmitted to humans by the bite of rodent fleas, typically when rodents die off.

The \ndrug of choice is chloramphenicol, though doxycycline is also effective.\nBOLIVIAN HEMORRHAGIC FEVER\nBolivian hemorrhagic fever has been re-ported from the Beni Department in the northeastern part of the country. The caus-ative organism, known as Machupo virus, is probably acquired by exposure to rodents.\nCHAGAS\u2019 DISEASE\nChagas\u2019 disease is a parasitic infection that is transmitted by triatomine insects (reduviid bugs), which inhabit crevices in the walls and roofs of substandard housing in South and Central America. In Bolivia most cases occur in temperate areas, especially in the departments of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Tarija. The triatomine insect lays its feces on human skin as it bites, usually at night. A person becomes infected when he or she unknowingly rubs the feces into the bite wound or sore. Chagas\u2019 disease is ex-tremely rare in travelers. However, always protect yourself with a bed net and a good insecticide if in mud, adobe or thatched houses. Do not accept blood transfusions if in these areas \u2013 local incidence of the disease is high.\nHIV/AIDS\nHIV/AIDS has been reported from all South American countries. Be sure to use condoms for all sexual encounters.\nLEISHMANIASIS\nLeishmaniasis occurs in the mountains and jungles of all South American countries except for Chile and Uruguay. The infection is transmitted by sandflies, which are about one-third the size of mosquitoes. In Bolivia, risk is greatest in the forested foothill re-gions east of the Andean Cordillera. Most cases of leishmaniasis are limited to the skin, causing slowly growing ulcers over exposed parts of the body. The more severe type, which disseminates to the bone marrow, liver and spleen, occurs only in the Yungas. Leishmaniasis may be particularly severe in those with HIV . There is no vaccine. To protect yourself from sandflies, follow the same precautions as for mosquitoes (p359), except that netting must be finer-mesh (at least 18 holes to the linear inch).toms, such as fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, backache, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually subside in a few days, but one person in six enters a second, toxic phase characterized by recur-rent fever, vomiting, listlessness, jaundice, kidney failure and hemorrhage, leading to death in up to half of the cases. At the present time, there is no treatment except for supportive and palliative care.\nY ellow-fever vaccine is strongly recom-\nmended for all those visiting areas where yellow fever occurs, which at time of pub-lication included the departments of Beni, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and La Paz. For the latest information on which areas in Bolivia are reporting yellow fever, go to the \u2018Blue Sheet\u2019 on the website of Centers \nfor Disease Control & Protection \n(CDC; www.cdc.gov/\ntravel/blusheet.htm) .\nProof of vaccination is required from \nall travelers arriving from a yellow-fever-infected country in Africa or the Americas.\nThe yellow-fever vaccine is given only \nin approved yellow fever vaccination centers, which provide validated International Certi-ficates of Vaccination (yellow booklets). The vaccine should be given at least 10 days be-fore any potential exposure to yellow fever, and remains effective for approximately 10 years. Reactions to the vaccine are gen-erally mild and may include headaches, muscle aches, low-grade fevers or dis-comfort at the injection site. Severe, life-threatening reactions have been described but are extremely rare. In general the risk of becoming ill from the vaccine is far less than the risk of becoming ill from yellow fever, and you\u2019re strongly encouraged to get the vaccine. \nTaking measures to protect yourself from \nmosquito bites (p359) is an essential part of preventing yellow fever.\nOther Infections\nBARTONELLOSIS\nBartonellosis (Oroya fever) is carried by sandflies in the arid river valleys on the western slopes of the Andes in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador between the alti-tudes of 800m (2625ft) and 3000m (9843ft).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4102, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "378146a6-c1a2-4e6c-afe9-beb96088ea66": {"__data__": {"id_": "378146a6-c1a2-4e6c-afe9-beb96088ea66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "357", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "217b0a86-48dd-495e-afc4-f67cc4f75d44", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "357", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "00fb41842897b98928657b4499c63b2d4af354457fb707fa3246ccbf429e777e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eda95334-c106-4e99-90e1-92967508973c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "357", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "e61ee3c983e769e3c9d72b18107323d66da8534a6297ac42b56c358632eb805b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Reactions to the vaccine are gen-erally mild and may include headaches, muscle aches, low-grade fevers or dis-comfort at the injection site.

Unlike aceta-zolamide, dexamethasone must be tapered gradually on arrival at altitude if taken for longer than 10 days, since there is a risk that altitude sickness will occur as the dosage is reduced. Dexamethasone is a steroid, so it should not be given to diabetics or anyone for whom steroids are contraindicated. A natural alternative is gingko, which helps some people.\nWhen traveling to high altitudes, it\u2019s also \nimportant to avoid overexertion, eat light meals and abstain from alcohol.\nIf your symptoms are more than mild \nor don\u2019t resolve promptly, see a doctor immediately. Altitude sickness should be taken very seriously; it can be life- threatening when severe.\nAnimal Bites\nDo not attempt to pet, handle or feed any animal, with the exception of domestic animals known to be free of any infectious disease. Most animal injuries are directly related to a person\u2019s attempt to touch or feed an animal.\nAny bite or scratch by a mammal, includ-\ning bats, should be promptly and thor oughly cleansed with large amounts of soap and water, followed by application of an antiseptic such as iodine or alcohol. The local health authorities should be contacted immedi-ately for possible post-exposure rabies treatment, whether or not you\u2019ve been immunized against rabies. It may also be advisable to start an antibiotic, since wounds caused by animal bites and scratches frequently become infected. Or use one of the newer quinolones, such TYPHUS\nTyphus may be transmitted by lice in mountainous areas near La Paz.\nTRAVELERS\u2019 DIARRHEA\nTo prevent diarrhea, avoid tap water unless it has been boiled, filtered or chemically dis-infected (with iodine tablets); only eat fresh fruits or vegetables if peeled or cooked; be wary of dairy products that might contain unpasteurized milk; and be highly selective when eating food from street vendors. \nIf you develop diarrhea, be sure to drink \nplenty of fluids, preferably an oral rehy-dration solution containing lots of salt and sugar. A few loose stools don\u2019t require treat-ment but if you start having more than four or five stools a day you should start taking an antibiotic (usually a quinolone drug) and an antidiarrheal agent (such as loper-amide). If diarrhea is bloody, or persists for more than 72 hours or is accom-panied by fever, shaking chills or severe abdominal pain, you should seek medical attention.\nENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS \nAltitude Sickness\nAltitude sickness may develop in those who ascend rapidly to altitudes greater than 2500m (8100ft). In Bolivia this includes La Paz (altitude 4000m). Being physically fit offers no protection. Those who have experienced altitude sickness in the past are prone to future episodes. The risk increases with faster ascents, higher altitudes and greater exertion. Symptoms may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, ma-laise, insomnia and loss of appetite. Severe cases may be further complicated by fluid in the lungs (high-altitude pulmonary edema) or swelling of the brain (high-altitude cerebral edema). \nThe best treatment for altitude sickness \nis descent. If you are exhibiting symptoms, do not ascend. If symptoms are severe or persistent, descend immediately.\nTo protect yourself against altitude sick-\nness, take 125mg or 250mg acetazolamide (Diamox) twice or three times daily, start-ing 24 hours before ascent and continuing for 48 hours after arrival at altitude. Pos-sible side effects include increased urinary volume, numbness, tingling, nausea, drow-siness, myopia and temporary impotence. \nFOLK MEDICINE\nProblem Treatment\nAltitude sickness Ginkgo; coca leaf tea\nJet lag MelatoninMotion sickness GingerMosquito-bite Oil of eucalyptus;  \nprevention  coconut oil\n21-health-bol7.indd   35821-health-bol7.indd   358 9/12/09   17:51:359/12/09   17:51:35", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4084, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee6e0218-9519-43c6-9109-a784a5c44a4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee6e0218-9519-43c6-9109-a784a5c44a4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "359", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ecfcb92e-de97-4cb6-b648-bedc6b739e91", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "359", "file_name": "Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/pepe/dev/upb/topicos/topicos-ia-2024-2do-parcial/data/Lonely Planet Bolivia (Country Travel Guide) - PDF Room.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 30067996, "creation_date": "2024-10-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-16"}, "hash": "061e58761d7f70bae8bc983059a37b6eb08abae764fc427dde41ec53f81a1cc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1eafe9e0-56b8-4543-b25e-37145936d7f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba8e5cf2a67c2f46b3b3d492a36c4bef8c5a9ec4260454b6a883a4e9e1ad4535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HEALTHlonelyplanet.com  IN BOLIVIA  \u2022\u2022  Traveling with Children   359\narea is not protected, use a mosquito coil, \nwhich will fill the room with insecticide through the night. Repellent-impregnated wristbands are not effective.\nSunburn & Heat Exhaustion\nTo protect yourself from excessive sun exposure, stay out of the midday sun, wear sunglasses and a wide-brimmed sun hat, and apply sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher, with both UV A and UVB protection. Sun-screen should be generously applied to all exposed parts of the body approximately 30 minutes before sun exposure and should be reapplied after swimming or vigorous activity. Travelers should also drink plenty of fluids and avoid strenuous exercise in high temperatures.\nWater\nTap water in Bolivia is not safe to drink. Vigorous boiling for one minute is the most effective means of water purification. At altitudes greater than 2000m (6500ft), boil for three minutes. \nAnother option is to disinfect water with \niodine pills such as Globaline, Potable-Aqua and Coghlan\u2019s, available at most pharma-cies. Instructions are enclosed and should be carefully followed. Or you can add 2% tincture of iodine to one quart or liter of water (five drops to clear water, 10 drops to cloudy water) and let it stand for 30 min-utes. If the water is cold, longer times may be required. The taste of iodinated water may be improved by adding vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Iodinated water should not be consumed for more than a few weeks. Pregnant women, those with a his-tory of thyroid disease and those allergic to iodine should not drink iodinated water.\nA number of water filters are on the \nmarket. Those with smaller pores (reverse osmosis filters) provide the broadest pro-tection, but they are relatively large and are readily plugged by debris. Those with larger pores (microstrainer filters) are ineffective against viruses, although they remove other organisms. Manufacturers\u2019 instructions must be carefully followed.\nTRAVELING WITH CHILDREN\nWhen traveling with young children, be particularly careful about what you allow them to eat and drink, because diarrhea can as levofloxacin (Levaquin), which many travelers carry in case of diarrhea.\nSnakes and leeches are a hazard in some \nareas of South America. In Bolivia there are two species of poisonous snakes: pit vipers (rattlesnakes) and coral snakes. These are found chiefly in sugar and banana plantations, and in the dry, hilly regions. In the event of a venomous snake bite, place the victim at rest, keep the bitten area immobilized and move the victim to the nearest medical facility immediately. Tourniquets are no longer recommended.\nInsect Bites & Stings\nTo prevent mosquito bites, wear long sleeves, long pants, hats and shoes (rather than sandals). Bring along a good insect repellent, preferably one containing DEET, which should be applied to exposed skin and clothing, but not to eyes, mouth, cuts, wounds or irritated skin. Products contain-ing lower concentrations of DEET are as ef-fective, but for shorter periods of time. In general, adults and children over 12 should use preparations containing 25% to 35% DEET, which usually lasts about six hours. Children between two and 12 years of age should use preparations containing no more than 10% DEET, applied sparingly, which will usually last about three hours. Neurologic toxicity has been reported from DEET, especially in children, but appears to be ex-tremely uncommon and generally related to overuse. DEET-containing compounds should not be used on children under age two.\nInsect repellents containing certain bo-\ntanical products, including oil of eucalyptus and soybean oil, are effective but last only 1\u00bd to two hours. DEET-contain-ing repellents are preferable for areas where there is a high risk of malaria or yellow fever. Products based on citronella are not effective.\nFor additional protection you can apply \npermethrin to clothing, shoes, tents and bed nets.

Thus vaca  \n(cow) and caballos  (horses) both carry \nstress on the next-to-last syllable, while ciu-\ndad (city) and infeliz  (unhappy) are both \nstressed on the last syllable.\nWritten accents will almost always appear \nin words that don\u2019t follow the rules above, eg \ns\u00f3tano  (basement), Am\u00e9rica  and porci\u00f3n  \n(portion). When counting syllables, be sure \nto remember that diphthongs (vowel combin-\nations, such as the \u2018ue\u2019 in puede ) constitute \nonly one. When a word with a written accent \nappears in capital letters, the accent is often \nnot written, but is still pronounced.\nGENDER & PLURALS\nIn Spanish, nouns are either masculine or feminine, and there are rules to help deter-\nmine gender (there are of course some ex-\nceptions). Feminine nouns generally end with - a or with the groups - ci\u00f3n, -si\u00f3n or - dad. \nOther endings typically signify a masculine \nnoun. Endings for adjectives change to agree with the gender of the noun they modify (masculine/feminine - o/-a). Where \nboth masculine and feminine forms are in-\ncluded in this language guide, they are separated by a slash, with the masculine \nform first, eg perdido/a .\nIf a noun or adjective ends in a vowel, the \nplural is formed by adding s to the end. If \nit ends in a consonant, the plural is formed \nby adding es to the end.

In 2002, she spent six weeks traveling around Bolivia, immedi-ately enchanted with its remote landscapes and indigenous cultures. She descended into the mines of Potos\u00ed, swam in Inca hot springs, found herself in the midst of a coca peasants\u2019 roadblock and got lost in the Amazon. For this book, she was repeatedly hit by water balloons leading up to Carnaval. Still, she\u2019d go back in a snap. \nKATE ARMSTRONG La Paz, Lake Titicaca\nKate first wandered to Bolivia during a year-long backpacking trip through South America. Captivated by the country\u2019s flavors, she holed up in Sucre to study Spanish and inadvertently joined a folkloric dance troupe after two ungraceful cueca lessons in her hiking boots. She returns regularly to Bolivia to search for the perfect salte\u00f1a, hike in the highlands and brush up \non her castellano. When not wandering the markets of La Paz, the Altiplano or Amazonian jungle, Kate is a freelance writer in Australia. \nPAUL SMITH The Cordilleras & Yungas, Central Highlands, \n South Central Bolivia & the Chaco, Santa Cruz & \n Gran Chiquitania, Amazon Basin\nFrom an early age, and with a vague and naive ambition to be the next \nDavid Attenborough, Paul dreamed of exploring the remotest corners of South America in search of wildlife. After spending two months at the Beni Biological Station as a student, that dream started to come true but, with David Attenborough still going strong, he changed his career plans, became a travel writer and moved to South America (Paraguay) permanently in 2003. While researching this edition, Paul spent a night on a bus in a mosquito-infested swamp somewhere between Rurre and Riberalta, overcame his fear of light aircrafts in Pando, learnt how to take his singani like a man in Tarija, \nand saw his first Red-fronted Macaw in Saipina.\nCONTRIBUTING AUTHOR\nDr David Goldberg MD  completed his training in internal medicine and infectious diseases at Columbia-\nPresbyterian Medical Center in New York City, where he has also served as voluntary faculty.

Traveller Corrections and Updates\n165Jan 10\nBolivia:  Salt plains tours: The entry fee to the National Park with Lago Colorado etc etc has gone up five times as of january 1st 2010.  It was previously 30BOB and is now 150BOB.  Many travellers were caught out, as we went into the Park onNew Year's Day.\n201Dec 09Parque Nacional Tunari: Please warn travellers on your website NOT to go to Tunari, right outside of Cochabamba. We were just robbed there by 3 punks with knives. I think this happens often, according to the guard. We were only 2km into the park with our kids, not too far from the entrance.  We took a taxi to the gate, we arrived at 12 noon on a Saturday. I think this is becoming a more common occurrence these days at this park, AFTER the fact we heard from a few people that they had heard this was becoming more and more of a problem. The guard tried to warn us but he used a colloquial spanish word for robber - \"pero\" - not \"ladron\" - so we did not understand him. They also stole our Lonely Planet Bolivia book!!!!   A German guy we saw in the park said he had heard of the same thing happening in the park. When it happens, they close the park gates and do not let anyone in. \n216Sep 10, eric neemann, Sucre \u2013 sights \u2013 Museo de la Catedral: the place is closed on Saturdays. ((the book says it's open).\n222Sep 10, eric neemann, Sucre \u2013 getting there \u2013 bus: micro A or 3 to the bus terminal don't go from along calle Espana but from along calle Ravelo.\n232Sep 10, eric neemann, Potosi \u2013 sights \u2013 convento de San Francisco: entrance is now B$15 including a photo permission.\n233Sep 10, eric neemann, Potosi \u2013 sights \u2013 Iglesia de la Merced: the place is totally closed, but you can visit during mass. \n240Jan 10With this email  we want to inform you that a New Bus Terminal was launched few weeks ago in Potosi (Bolivia-South America)  this is a new building located very far from city center (almost 20 min by taxi and 40 min in a local bus service). Also  you can check information about this issue at the local newspaper El Potosi at http://www.elpotosi.net/noticias/2009/1229/noticias.php?nota=29_12_09_loca5.php Unfortunatelly many tourist only found problems, because the new terminal does not exist in the guidebooks and they do not realize that Potosi actually has a new Bus Terminal, not only for people who arrives to Potosi also who leaves Potosi.
